<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>When
the fieldwork is done and the data entry completed, the fun really begins.
To illustrate some more principles of data analysis, let us assume that
you are analyzing a public opinion poll. The first thing you want to see
is the marginal frequencies: the number and percentage of people who have
each of the possible responses to each of the questions in the survey.
Determining this basic information is not as clear-cut as it sounds, however,
and a few policy decisions must be made in advance.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>First
among them is the problem of dealing with answers of the don't-know, no-opinion,
and no-answer variety. Do you leave them in the base for calculating percentages,
or do you take them out? It can make a difference. Suppose you ask 500
people, "On the whole, do you approve or disapprove of the way the mayor
is handling his job?" and you get the following distribution:</font>&nbsp;</font>

<p><br><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Mayor Frump suddenly
looks better. Much of his looking better, of course, is based on the artificial
distinction between a minority and a majority. The four-point difference
would not seem nearly as important if the range were, say, from 42 to 46.
And since no election is involved here, the question of majority support
is not particularly germane. Moreover, the apparent majority or lack of
it could be due to sampling error. Artificial as the distinction may be,
however, it is one that can quickly catch the reader's eye and one that
will be overemphasized despite your best efforts to keep it in perspective.
The choice of a base for computing percentage is therefore crucial.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><b><font face="arial, palatino"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Deciding
what to count</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>So
here you sit with a survey containing perhaps two hundred questions, and
each of them is subject to three different interpretations. You are a writer
of news stories, not lengthy scholarly treatises. What do you do? A rule
set forth in the previous chapter is so important that it is worth repeating
here:</font></font>
<center>
<p><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size=+0>"Don't know" is data.</font></font></center>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
soundest procedure is to base your percentages on the nonblank answers,
as in the second of the three examples cited above. It is theoretically
justifiable because not answering a particular question is in somewhat
the same category as not responding to the entire questionnaire. The reasons
for no answer are varied: the interviewer may have been careless and failed
to mark that question or failed to ask it, or the respondent may have refused
to answer. In any case, failure to answer may be treated as not being in
the completed sample for that particular question. You should, of course,
be on the lookout for items for which the no-answer rate is particularly
high. They may be a tipoff to a particularly sensitive or controversial
issue worth alerting your readers about; and you will, of course, want
to warn the reader whenever you find meaningful responses that are based
on considerably less than the total sample.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Usually,
however, the no-answer rate will be small enough to be considered trivial,
and you can base your percentages on the nonblank answers with a clear
conscience and without elaborate explanation.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
don't-know category is quite different. The inability of a respondent to
choose between alternatives is important information, and this category
should be considered as important data -- as important as that furnished
by people who&nbsp;<a NAME="142"></a>can make up their minds. In an election
campaign, for example, a high undecided rate is a tipoff that the situation
is still unstable. In the example just examined it suggests a substantial
lack of interest in or information about the mayor -- although these are
qualities best measured more directly.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Therefore,
you should, as a matter of routine, include the don't-knows in the basic
frequency count and report them. When you judge it newsworthy to report
percentages based on only the decided response, you can do that, too. But
present it as supplementary information: "Among those with opinions, Mayor
Frump scored a substantial . . ."</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>When
you do your counting with a computer, it is an easy matter to set it to
base the percentages on the nonblank answers and also report the number
of blanks. If you are working with SAS or SPSS, the frequency procedures
will automatically give you percentages both ways, with the missing data
in and out.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p style="line-height: 140%"><b><font face="arial, palatino"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Beyond
the marginals</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Either
way, you can quickly size up your results if you enter the percentages
on an unused copy of the interview schedule. Before going further, you
will want to make some external validity checks. Are males and females
fairly equal in number? Does the age distribution fit what you know about
the population from other sources, such as census data? Does voting behavior
fit the known results (allowing for the expected overrecall in favor of
the winning candidates)? With any luck, each of these distributions will
fall within the sampling error tolerances. If not, you will have to figure
out why, and what to do about it. Once you know the percentage who gave
each of the alternative responses to each of the questions, you already
have quite a bit to write about. <i>USA Today </i>can produce a newspaper
column from three or four questions alone. However, the frequencies --
or marginals, as social scientists like to call them --</font><font size=-1>
</font><font size=+1>are not the entire story. Often they are not even
very interesting or meaningful standing by themselves. If I tell you that
75 percent of the General Social Survey's national sample says the government
spends "too little" on improving the environment, it may strike you as
mildly interesting at&nbsp;<a NAME="143"></a>most, but not especially meaningful.
To put meaning into that 75 percent figure, I must compare it with something
else. If I tell you that in a similar national sample two years earlier,
only 68 percent gave that response, and that it was 59 percent four years
earlier, you can see that something interesting is going on in the nation.
And that is just what the General Social Survey did show in the years 1989,
1987, and 1985. A one-shot survey cannot provide such a comparison, of
course. However, if the question has been asked in other surveys of other
populations, you can make a comparison that may prove newsworthy. That
is one benefit of using questions that have been used before in national
samples. For example, a 1969 survey of young people who had been arrested
in December 1964 at the University of California sit-in used a question
on faith in government taken from a national study by the Michigan Survey
Research Center. The resulting comparison showed the former radicals to
have much less faith in government than did the nation as a whole.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p style="line-height: 140%"><b><font face="arial, palatino"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Internal
comparisons</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Important
opportunities for comparison may also be found within the survey itself.
That 75 percent of Miami blacks are in favor of improving their lot through
more political power is a fact which takes on new meaning when it is compared
to the proportion who favor other measures for improvement. In a list of
possible action programs for Miami blacks, encompassing a spectrum from
improving education to rioting in the streets, education ranked at the
very top, with 96 percent rating it "very important." Violent behavior
ranked quite low on the list.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>And
this brings us anew to the problem of interpretation raised in the opening
chapter of this book. You can report the numbers, pad some words around
them, the way wire-service writers in one-person bureaus construct brief
stories about high school football games from the box scores, and let it
go at that, leaving the reader to figure out what it all means. Or you
can do the statistical analog of reporter's leg-work, and dig inside your
data to find the meaning there.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>One
example will suffice to show the need for digging.&nbsp;<a NAME="144"></a>A
lot has been written about generational differences, particularly the contrast
between the baby boomers and the rest of the population. And almost any
national survey will show that age is a powerful explanatory variable.
One of the most dramatic presentations of this kind of data was made by
CBS News in a three-part series in May and June of 1969. Survey data gathered
by Daniel Yankelovich, Inc., was illustrated by back-to-back interviews
with children and their parents expressing opposite points of view. The
sample was drawn from two populations: college youth and their parents
constituted one population; noncollege youth and their parents the other.
Here is just one illustrative comparison: Asked whether "fighting for our
honor" was worth having a war, 25 percent of the college youth said yes,
compared to 40 percent of their parents, a difference of 15 percentage
points.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>However,
tucked away on page 186 on Yankelovich's 213-page report to CBS, which
formed the basis for the broadcasts, was another interesting comparison.
Among college-educated parents of college children, only 35 percent thought
fighting for our honor was enough to justify a war. By restricting comparison
to college-educated people of both generations, the level of education
was held constant, and the effect of age, i.e., the generation gap, was
reduced to a difference of 10 percentage points.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Yankelovich
had an even more interesting comparison back there on page 186. He separated
out the noncollege parents of the noncollege kids to see what they thought
about having a war over national honor. And 67 percent of them were for
it. Therefore, on this one indicator we find a gap of 32 percentage points
between college-educated adults with kids in college and their adult peers
in noncollege families:</font>&nbsp;</font>

<br><font size=+1>Obviously, a lot more is going on here than just a generation
gap. The education and social-class gap is considerably stronger. Yankelovich
pursued the matter further by making comparisons within the younger generation.
"The intra-generation gap, i.e., the divisions within youth itself," he
told CBS a month before the first broadcast, "is greater in most instances
than the division between the generations."</font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
same thing has turned up in other surveys. Hold education constant, and
the generation gap fades. Hold age constant, and a big social-class gap
-- a wide divergence of attitudes between the educated and the uneducated
-- opens up. Therefore, to attribute the divisions in American society
to age differences is worse than an oversimplification. It is largely wrong

CBS, pressed for time, as most of us usually are in the news business,
chose to broadcast and illustrate the superficial data which supported
the preconceived, conventional-wisdom thesis of the generation gap.</font></font>

<p><br><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Carter support was four
points greater among the "highly religious" than the "not so religious"
(42 to 38). But the&nbsp;<a NAME="146"></a>difference was not statistically
significant. As it turned out, however, the shoe-leather guys were right.
There was a religion effect if you knew where to look for it. Carter had
a strong appeal to young people, and young people tend to be less religious.
Carter's religiosity did not have much effect on older people whose political
beliefs were well established. The religion appeal worked mainly on the
young. Variables that conceal effects this way have been called "suppressor
and distorter variables" by Morris Rosenberg.<a NAME="6return1" href="Chapter6.htm#6-1"></a><sup><a href="Chapter6.htm#6-1" name="6return1">1</a></sup>
The way to find the effect is to look at Carter support by churchgoing
behavior within each age group. When that was done, a strong church effect
favoring Carter appeared among those aged 18 to 41.</font></font>

nature, and because the analysis was fairly basic. We shall start with
a simple two-way table. A two-way (or bivariate) table simply sorts a sample
population into each of the possible combinations of categories. This one
uses age and conventional militancy among Miami blacks. In the first pass
through the data, age was divided four ways, militancy into three.</font>&nbsp;</font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
problem of figuring which way the percentages run may seem confusing at
first, but eventually you will get the hang of it. To make it easier, most
of the tables in this book base the percentages on column sums. Thus the
dependent variable -- the quality being dissected -- is listed across the
rows. No law of social science requires this arrangement. We could just
as logically put the dependent variable in columns and figure percent across
rows. In some cases, to clarify a distribution, you may want to base percentage
on the table total, i.e., the sum in the corner of the margins. But for
now we shall standardize with the dependent variable reported across rows
and the percentages based on totals down the columns.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>With
this standard presentation, you can quickly gain the habit of letting your
eye rove from left to right to find the percent difference. The table comparing
the proportion of younger and older people among the militants shows older
people have half again as many conservatives or low militants among them
as younger people have: 31 percent vs. 21 percent. And that is a fairly
good way to explain it to the reader.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>But
if it takes you some time to develop your table-reading skill so that the
figures leap off the page at you, bright and meaningful, consider the plight
of the reader. Your practice and skill at interpretation do not help him
or her, and so you have to reduce things to words or to bare numerical
essentials, or both in combination. One way to ease the burden on the reader
is to give him or her one-way tables, created by lopping off the less dramatic
half of the two-way table. Even then, you should add some words to tell
what the numbers are saying. Here is how the relationship between militancy
and age could be presented:</font></font>

</table></center>

<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
other half of the table, the percent nonmilitant in each category, is implied.
And the table makes clear that the numbers are percentages within age categories.</font></font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><a NAME="149"></a><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>What
about the don't-knows? Shouldn't there be cells in the table for them?
Not in this case. The militant was operationally defined as someone who
gave militant answers to six of the eight questions in the index. "No answer,"
therefore, counted as a nonmilitant answer. Had the number of blanks for
any one of the items been unusually high, some theoretical problems could
have been raised. They weren't. In a few cases, interviewers failed to
record age, and those cases were automatically eliminated from the table.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Now
we must reflect a bit on what we have added to the newspaper reader's knowledge
here. We have made a comparison between young and old and demonstrated
that militancy is found more frequently among the young. That in itself
is something of an achievement because it provides a fuller description
of the phenomenon of militancy than was available before we produced the
table. Age and militancy are related.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Can
we go beyond that and assume that the relationship involves causation?
Nothing in the numbers themselves demonstrates that the relationship is
a causal one. To make the leap to a causal assumption, we have to use some
logic, a bit of intuition, and common sense. And that, you may remember
from an earlier chapter, is why we keep referring to one variable as the
dependent variable and the other as the independent variable. This description
is the most parsimonious and conservative one available. We can say that
we are looking for evidence that militancy <i>depends</i> on age without
committing ourselves to talking about causation. The statement that the
amount of militancy depends on age is purely a descriptive one. (Or, if
the row comparisons had turned out to be about equal, we could have said
that militancy does not depend on age.)</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Now
let us look at this particular table and bring some logic to bear on it.
If there is a relationship between the two variables, then it could be
because one of them is a cause of the other. But which way does the causal
arrow run? In this case, it is easy to eliminate the hypothesis that militancy
causes age. Chronological age, more's the pity, is fixed and unchangeable,
so the arrow must run the other way. Other&nbsp;<a NAME="150"></a>readily
measured attributes possess the same advantage in deducing causality: sex,
race, birth order within the family are examples. Because they are unchangeable,
we can assume that they are causes and not effects, if there is causation.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>For
illustration, we return to the case of the Miami blacks. Militancy can't
cause people to be young, but the reverse proposition, that being young
causes them to be militant, also lacks a good deal. What we really want
to know is what it is about being young that makes people militant.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
way to find out is to look first for other dimensions where young people
differ from old: education, for example. People in all social classes tend
to be better educated than their parents. Among Miami blacks more than
24 years old, 25 percent had high school diplomas. Only 12 percent of their
fathers were high school graduates. Furthermore, we can expect militancy
to increase with education.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Knowing
this, we then suspect that it may not be youth <i>per se</i> that causes
militancy, but merely the fact that young blacks are better educated, and
that better education is the real cause of militancy. To test this idea,
we first verify our suspicion that education is related to militancy. And
indeed it is. Reducing the table to a newspaper-compatible form produces
the following evidence that militancy increases with education.</font>&nbsp;</font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>At
first glance, education seems to have even more to do with militancy than
does age. Perhaps age is not a "real" factor at all. Maybe it is simply
a cause of education, which is then the more direct cause of militancy.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>To
test this idea, we introduce what Morris Rosenberg&nbsp;<a NAME="151"></a>calls
a test factor.<a NAME="6return2" href="Chapter6.htm#6-2"></a><sup><a href="Chapter6.htm#6-2" name="6return2">2</a></sup>
Another word for it is control. As in the CBS report, we want to control
for age -- this time to examine the relationship between militancy and
education. Controlling for age means to hold its effect constant by looking
at the effect of education on militancy within each age category. This
process is analogous to the laboratory scientist who, by repeating his
experiment in a variety of temperatures, makes certain that variation in
room temperature is not affecting his chemical reaction.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
result of such an examination is a three-way table: militancy by education
by age. In physical printout, it is a two-way table repeated for each educational
category -- the only way that a three-dimensional table can be reproduced
on two-dimensional paper.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Several
things might happen:</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>1.
The education-militancy relationship could disappear within each of the
age groups. If so, age, not education, is the cause of militancy. Age,
in fact, is a common cause of both education and militancy and the apparent
education-militancy relationship is spurious.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>2.
The education-militancy relationship could remain in each of the age categories.
In this case, age and militancy are both links in the causal chain. Logic
tell us that age, being fixed, comes first. Therefore, youth causes education
and education causes militancy.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>3.
The education-militancy relationship could disappear in some of the age
categories and remain the same or become stronger in others. If so, some
kind of interaction effect is operating. There are special circumstances
in which age and education work together to increase militancy -- more,
perhaps, than simple addition of their separate effects would account for.</font></font>

of the above really happened in the Miami case?</font></font>

<p><br><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>As you can see, education
and militancy are related in all age categories. The second of the three
hypotheses is sustained. It is not the ebullience of youth so much that
produces militant attitudes. Rather, it is the greater educational opportunity
open to young people, which in turn increases their militancy. This finding
fits neatly into a larger theoretical framework of rising aspirations:
education moves people closer to goals and increases their expectations.
Higher expectations, left unfulfilled, produce frustration and militancy.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>This
example deals with a relationship between what Rosenberg calls a "property"
(age) and "disposition" (militancy). Properties are unambiguous, things
an individual is or isn't: white, German-born, grammar school graduate,
blue-collar worker, 1968 Nixon voter, color-television owner, teetotaler,
licensed airplane pilot, pack-a-day cigarette smoker. Dispositions are
more difficult to get a grip on because they are qualities that need the
presence of special situations in order to be activated. The black militant,
i.e., a black person scoring high on the militancy scale, may or may not
express his or her disposition by behaving in a militant manner, depending,
normally, on the external situation he or she faces at any given moment.
But the disposition is there and it is measurable. One of the things that
some social scientists try very hard to do is to establish relationships
between dispositions&nbsp;<a NAME="153"></a>and behavior. Another school,
however, holds that dispositions -- the attitudes, values, personality
traits within the person </font><font size=-1>&ntilde; </font><font size=+1>have
much less to do with behavior than does the external situation.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>It
is generally much easier to establish the relationship between a property
and a disposition than to predict actual behavior, as in the case of the
age-education-militancy chain. However, you can find news applications
of both types, although you may find that you are unable to interest your
editors or your readers in attitudinal relationships until dispositions
are manifested in newsworthy behavior. We become interested in what blacks
or students or public school teachers are thinking after they riot or eject
the dean from his office or go on strike. Nevertheless, a news organization
that takes the new methods seriously will try to monitor the attitudinal
developments before matters reach the overt, obviously newsworthy, man-bites-dog
level. If a man biting a dog is news, a man thinking about biting a dog
is a potential scoop.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If
a disposition is the dependent variable, i.e., the thing being studied,
you then can quickly find yourself in the business of searching for relationships
between one disposition and another. In the <i>Miami Herald</i>'s pre-riot
survey of early 1968, one of the important dependent variables was disposition
toward violence. It was measured with two questionnaire items, one dealing
with general approval of violence to advance black goals and the other
asking about the respondent's own intent to participate in such violence
should the opportunity arise. The two items were combined to form a four-part
index ranging from "violent" -- those who both favored violence as an idea
and were ready to participate themselves -- to those who were opposed to
both the concept and the personal act. It was then tested against a number
of specific grievances to find out, first, whether grievances really do
dispose people toward thoughts of violence, and, if so, which grievances
had the most effect.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>One
of the more clear-cut tables showed quite plainly that disposition toward
violence was associated with dissatisfaction over one's personal housing
situation.</font></font>

<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
relationship persists in each age group, though it comes on significantly
stronger in the middle-aged, 36-50, group. Therefore, at least two things
are probably going on here: first, youth, or something about youth, causes
people to feel and express grievances over housing and the grievances in
turn stimulate favorable attitudes toward violence. But look at the third
age category. Housing is strongest as an explanatory variable for violence
in that age group for which it is most relevant: these are people in the
middle-to-late child-rearing years for whom being deprived of satisfactory
housing can be the most frustrating. Thus bad housing makes these&nbsp;<a NAME="155"></a>people
disposed toward violence despite their age; age, negatively associated
with violence (the greater the age, the less the violence) has thus had
a suppressor effect in the previous two-way table, which tested for the
effect of housing dissatisfaction on violence.</font></font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Or,
recasting this statement in shorter sentences:</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Disposition
toward violence decreases with age.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Disposition

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Among
middle-aged people, housing dissatisfaction relates so strongly to disposition
toward violence as to outweigh the violence-suppressing effect of age.
When you can pinpoint a group in which special circumstances make a relationship
stand out with extra power and clarity you have a strong potential for
an important news story. In Miami, urban affairs writer Juanita Greene
found that housing frustrations for people in the child-rearing years were
grounded in objective reality. The gap between housing need and housing
availability was large and it was not being closed. This kind of spotting
of special situations, by the way, is something that social scientists,
in their quest for general theoretical principles, do not often do very
well. "Social science has been justly criticized," says Rosenberg, "for
its neglect of situational factors. One may know that general principles
obtain, but one does not know whether these principles have predictive
value in specific circumstances."<a NAME="6return3" href="Chapter6.htm#6-3"></a><sup><a href="Chapter6.htm#6-3" name="6return3">3</a></sup>
Digging for specific circumstances may fit the instincts of the journalist
better than those of the social scientist. Academic reluctance to ferret
out the mundane details needn't inhibit us at all as we look for the traditional
who, what, when, where, why, and how.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Before
leaving the violence-by-housing and satisfaction-by-age tables as compressed
above, scan it once more to see how quickly you are becoming accustomed
to letting the numbers leap off the page, bearing their message to you.
Your eye automatically scans from left to right to show that housing attitudes
relate to violence attitudes in all age groups. But you can also scan it
vertically to see how attitudes favoring violence tend to fade with advancing
age. The percent disposed to violence fades from 21 to 12 among those happy&nbsp;<a NAME="156"></a>with
housing conditions and from 33 to 20 among those unhappy with housing conditions.
Furthermore, the exception, that 40 percent violent among the unhappy 36-50
group, cries out for attention and explanation.</font></font>

you apply them to work of your own and not just to examples printed in
a book. You may also take comfort from this thought: you are avoiding,
so far, the danger of becoming so fluent with numbers that you begin to
lose your ability to put their meaning into words that newspaper readers
can understand and appreciate. This hazard is well known to social scientists,
especially among students getting a grip on quantitative methods for the
first time. They sometimes reach a stage in which they resent the fact
that they can't simply send the computer printout to the publishers and
have its significance instantly appreciated and spread upon the record
for all the world to see. It doesn't work that way for them and it especially
doesn't work that way for us in journalism. We write with words, but we
must learn to read in numbers.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><b><font face="arial, helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>More
than one independent variable</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>We
have now seen some of the things that can happen to a simple two-variable
relationship when a third variable, related to both, is introduced. One
more example deserves some examination. This is the case where the third
variable is not really a test or control variable but acts as a second
independent variable. In other words, we find two things which relate to
the phenomenon under study and their impact appears to be cumulative. There
are ways to sort out the relative contribution of the two independent variables.
However, in a newspaper story, about all you need to get across is that
they exist, that they affect the dependent variable, and that their effect
is cumulative.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In
the five-year follow-up study of Berkeley arrestees, for example, an effort
was made to determine what made some of the former student radicals --
a minority as it turned out --<a NAME="157"></a>become relatively conservative
in their political behavior. A political conservative in this context was
someone who voted for Hubert Humphrey in 1968 (no one in this group voted
for Nixon). A vote for Humphrey represented an act within the political
system and not a protest, as a write-in vote for Eugene McCarthy, Dick
Gregory, Eldridge Cleaver, Pat Paulsen, or a deliberate nonvote would be.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Several
factors were associated with a Humphrey vote, of which two are worth mentioning
here as examples: a general low level of self-perceived radicalism, and
the acquisition of a spouse since the 1964 arrests.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Among
all those arrestees who responded to the mail survey, 33 percent voted
for Humphrey. Among those who got married after the sit-in, 43 percent
voted for him. Among those who placed themselves in the lower two-thirds
on a self-anchoring scale of radicalism, 49 percent voted for Humphrey.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Immediately,
the hypothesis suggests itself that the less radical are the more likely
to do conventional things like getting married, and these two independent
variables -- marriage and low self-assessed radicalism </font><font size=-1>&ntilde;
</font><font size=+1>are telling us the same thing. It seems likely that
radical students, being dedicated to their causes, would have little time
or inclination for such a conventional institution as marriage. In fact,
however, there was no significant difference in the marriage rate of the
high-radical group and the low-radical group. What difference there was
indicated that those who were still single five years later tended to rank
somewhat lower in radicalism.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>This
lack of correlation between the two independent variables means, then,
that their effect must be cumulative. The existence of both conditions,
low radicalism and marriage, should produce a higher rate of Humphrey voting
than either condition separately. It did, and the effect was easily demonstrated
with numbers that could be interpreted to readers:</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Forty-three
percent of the married subjects voted for Humphrey.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Forty-nine
percent of the low-radicalism subjects voted for Humphrey.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Sixty-one
percent&nbsp;<a NAME="158"></a>of the married, low-radicalism subjects
voted for Humphrey.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>From
these examples, you can see how the introduction of a third variable to
elaborate on what you already know about a two-variable relationship can
do three basic things:</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>1.
It can spot a spurious relationship. Example: People who eat candy have
a lower death rate than those who do not eat candy. Therefore, eating candy
causes longevity? No. Children eat candy, and children have yet to face
the death-causing infirmities of old age. Control for age, and the relationship
between candy eating and death rate disappears.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>2.
It can isolate the conditions in which the relationship is strongest and
most important. Example: Newspaper readership in a southern city declines
among younger age groups, a finding which raises the suspicion that the
paper is losing touch with the educated younger generation. But when the
relationship is controlled for education, nearly all of the young-readership
decline is found to be among the least educated. This discovery opens a
whole new line of inquiry, directed at the substitution of television for
newspapers among the uneducated young, and a projection of future trends
as the number of uneducated young people continues to dwindle.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>3.
Chains of causation can be sorted out and interactive or cumulative effects
discovered. Example: Among Miami blacks in 1968, those scoring highest
on a measure of political effectiveness tended to score high on conventional
(as opposed to radical) militancy. Both measures also were positively correlated
with income. Treating income as a separate independent variable demonstrated
that it and political efficacy tended to operate cumulatively: each made
a separate contribution to increased militancy.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Until
this chapter, when you thought of a variable you probably thought of a
single question item in the interview schedule. And most of the time that
is exactly what a variable will be. However, you must learn early in the
game not to let your imagination be limited by single-item variables. It
often makes sense to combine two or more to create an entirely new measure.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p style="line-height: 140%"><a NAME="159"></a><b><font face="arial, helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>New
variables from old</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>One
of the classic combined variables in social science literature is status
inconsistency. Take two measures of socioeconomic status, education and
income, for example. People who rank high in both or low in both are status-consistent.
Those who are high in one but low in the other are status-inconsistent.
And, research has shown, status-inconsistent people are different. It is
a useful variable.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Another
way to create new variables from old is in index construction. The new
variables are not really "new" in that they involve a different property
or disposition. Rather, they provide a more accurate and flexible indicator
of what you are trying to measure. To return to the black militancy example,
its eight items are a better collective measure of the disposition than
any single item. One obvious advantage is that you can rank order the individuals
in the sample according to the number of militant answers given. The choice
of which of the available intercorrelated items to use in the index may
be somewhat arbitrary, but you needn't worry about it. As Paul Lazarsfeld
has pointed out, indices measuring the same phenomenon tend to be interchangeable.<a NAME="6return4" href="Chapter6.htm#6-4"></a><sup><a href="Chapter6.htm#6-4" name="6return4">4</a></sup>
Shifting combinations of indicators will mean that some people will fall
into or out of the defined group with each change. However, the different
combinations are not likely to make any substantive change in the results
when you look for relationships with another variable. We could take any
four of the eight conventional militancy items and use them for a dichotomized
index and still find that conventional militancy correlates with education.
Then we could take the other four, try again, and again get the same general
finding.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>For
this reason, there is usually little need to use as many as eight items
in an index. Two or three will often do quite as well. And, in the case
of socioeconomic status, you may often find cases where you will be content
to use education as the only indicator. Sometimes the response rate is
low on the income question, and occupation involves a difficult (though
not insurmountable) coding problem. But both correlate well enough with
education that, for many research purposes, you can get by with education
alone.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><a NAME="160"></a><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>You
don't see many newspaper stories based on indices. That's a pity because
index construction can add to the power and interpretability of polling
data. And you should start to think about ways of analyzing survey data
that go well beyond the basic frequency count -- how many people gave each
answer to each question -- and even beyond simple bivariate comparisons
-- how high-income people compare to low-income people, city dwellers vs.
suburbanites, etc. How can such painstaking analysis be made to fit into
the time constraints of journalism?</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>It
is easier than you might think. Even though the bulk of what you write
from survey data will probably be based on the marginal frequencies and
simple two-way relationships, it pays to stay alert to situations where
deeper analysis can be useful.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>One

unsound in most cases. The assumptions underlying correlation (Pearsonian

can only be ordinally scaled at best. But the computer&nbsp;<a NAME="161"></a>doesn't
know what kind of scales or indices your numbers represent. It will produce
a correlation matrix which will have enough approximate validity to be
useful as a searching device. Your eye can scan the rows and columns of

can ask yourself why, and then run contingency tables to find out what

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
correlation matrix can also guide you in the construction of indices out
of several variables. If you think that several questionnaire items all
tap a common characteristic, such as disposition toward violence, dissatisfaction
with local government services, or racial prejudice, then you can get a
quick estimate of their validity as an index by seeing whether they intercorrelate.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>How
do you tell what items are suitable for an index? You want them to have
low intercorrelations, in the neighborhood of .2 to .5. If the intercorrelations
are too high, the items are redundant, measuring too much the same thing.
If they are too low, they are measuring different things. There are several
statistical tests to guide you in building indices. Chronbach's Alpha is
available in SPSS. It provides an estimate of the extent to which all of
the items in an index are measuring the same underlying characteristic.
How does it do this? For a direct explanation, you need a statistics test.
For most purposes, it is enough to think of it as a measure of internal
consistency. A low Alpha score means that you probably have an apples-and-oranges
problem, i.e., the items in your index are not really measuring the same
thing. The accepted interpretation of Chronbach's Alpha<a NAME="6return5" href="Chapter6.htm#6-5"></a><sup><a href="Chapter6.htm#6-5" name="6return5">5</a></sup>
is that an alpha of .7 means that an index is good enough for exploratory
research, and if it is .8 or more, you can use it in a confirmatory application.<a NAME="6return6" href="Chapter6.htm#6-6"></a><sup><a href="Chapter6.htm#6-6" name="6return6">6</a></sup>
The same SPSS routine that produces it will also tell you how badly you
need each item in the index. It looks at each one in turn and tells you
how much Alpha&nbsp;<a NAME="162"></a>will be reduced if the item is dropped.
You would not want to bother newspaper readers with this information, but
it can be good for your own peace of mind.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>This
quick search for things that hang together can be carried a step further
with a factor analysis program which combs through a correlation matrix
and picks out the clusters of variables that stick together with the most
mathematical precision. The logic of factor analysis assumes that your
variables are surface manifestations of some underlying condition and the
optimum alignment of the intercorrelated variables will show what these
underlying situations are. The trouble with this particular tool is that
it is so powerful that it will cause factors to surface for you whether
or not they are real. So you have to look at it with a skeptical eye and
ask yourself whether they make any intuitive or theoretical sense. When
they do, you can use them as indices to construct variables that will usually
work better than single-item indicators.</font></font>

example of a case in which this procedure was successful is the 1968 Detroit
study of black attitudes in the 1967 riot area. A number of items that
dealt with possible courses of actions toward black achievement were intercorrelated
and factor analyzed. The program called for orthogonal factors to be extracted
</font><font size=-1>&ntilde;</font><font size=+1>a shorthand way of saying
that the items within each factor should correlate with another in that
factor but that the separate factors should <u>not</u> be intercorrelated.
Thus each factor represents a separate dimension unrelated to the others.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In
the Detroit study, the first two factors extracted made good sense. The
first was labeled "black power," and its strongest components were positive
responses to statements such as "blacks should get more political power
by voting together to get officials who will look out for the Negro people"
and "blacks should get more economic power by developing strong businesses
and industries that are controlled by blacks."</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
second factor was labeled "black nationalism." (The computer, it should
be noted, does not invent these labels. You have to do it yourself.) Its
strongest components included agreement with statements such as "It is
very important&nbsp;<a NAME="163"></a>for blacks to avoid having anything
to do with white people as much as possible" and "It is very important
for blacks to be ready to fight alongside other blacks and participate
in riots if necessary."</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Finally
it was shown that a sizable majority of Detroit blacks subscribed to the
black power idea as defined in the conservative, self-help sense, and that
very few were disposed to black nationalism. That these two dimensions
were different and unrelated things was news to many whites who were accustomed
to thinking of the extreme forms of militancy as differing only in degree
from the black power concept. It is a difference in kind, not in degree.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Although
the discovery was accomplished through factor analysis, the proof did not
rest on this rather intricate and difficult-to-explain tool. Indices of
black power and black nationalism were constructed, collapsed into categories
for contingency tables, and run against one another to verify the absence
of a relationship. This step was necessary not only for simplification,
but as a check against the misuse of factor analysis. For our purposes
especially, it should only be used to discover clues to things that can
be described in a more straightforward manner.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>There
are other tricks that can be done with a correlation matrix. When there
are several independent variables associated with the dependent variable,
it is a shortcut for sorting out the effect of each by computing what is
called the partial correlation coefficient. For example, in a survey of
voters in Muncie, Indiana, in 1964, the correlation between political interest
and income was .212, suggesting that people with money have more at stake
in political decisions and therefore pay more attention to politics. On
the other hand, income and education were very definitely correlated (<i>r</i>
= .408), and there was a small but significant link between education and
political interest (<i>r </i>= .181). Using contingency tables, it is possible
to test the relationship between political interest and income by looking
at it within categories of education. But that means another trip to the
computing center. Partial correlation offers a quicker way to estimate
the effect of holding education constant.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><a NAME="164"></a><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
correlation matrix has one other special application if you have panel
data. It can, sometimes, give you an easy way to spot the direction of
causation. Suppose you have interviewed the same people in two projects
a year apart. Each survey shows a relationship between interest in local
politics and time spent reading the morning paper. The question bothering
you is which comes first in the causal chain (<u>if</u> one does come first;
it could be a case of mutual causation). Out of the correlation matrix,
you find that there is a significantly stronger relationship between interest
in politics at time 1 and newspaper reading at time 2 than there is between
newspaper reading at time 1 and interest in politics at time 2. The predominant
direction of causation, then, is from interest in politics to newspaper
reading. See Figure 6A.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>You
may have noticed by now that you are beginning to see social science methodology
in a somewhat new light. With any luck, it should begin to look like something
you can do rather than just passively observe and write about.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>There
is another corner which we have turned in this chapter. We have not, you
may have noticed, made a big deal of significance testing in the discussion
of survey analysis. And we have put a lot of emphasis on digging and searching
procedures which don't quite square with the pure model of hypothesis testing
which was presented earlier in this book.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><a NAME="165"></a><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Is
this, then, the point of transition from scholarship to journalism? Not
exactly. The better, more creative scholars know that the search for probable
cause is where the action is in survey research, and statistical testing
is trivial by comparison. The tests help you guard against the temptations
of overinterpretation. But analysis of tables, with the introduction of
third variables to go behind the superficial, two-variable relationships,
is your protection against wrong interpretation. It is also your opportunity
to discover causal sequences and explanations of the way things work in
your community that you didn't suspect existed before.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In
classical scientific method, you form a hypothesis, test it, and, if it
fails the test, reject it and go on to something else. You don't keep cranking
in epicycles as Ptolemy did until you have a clumsy, unparsimonious explanation
to fit the observable data. Nevertheless, the rule against making interpretations
after the fact, after the data are in and the printed-out tables are on
your desk, is by no means ironclad. There is room in social science for
serendipity. If the data give you an idea that you didn't have before,
you need feel no guilt at all about pursuing it through the tables to see
where it leads. Rosenberg notes that cases of serendipitous discoveries
are plentiful in both the natural and the social sciences. He cites one
of the best and most original concepts to emerge from modern survey research
as an example: relative deprivation, uncovered by Samuel Stouffer in his
research for <i>The American Soldier.<a NAME="6return7" href="Chapter6.htm#6-7"></a></i><sup><a href="Chapter6.htm#6-7" name="6return7">7</a></sup></font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Stouffer
did not enter this survey with the idea that there might be such a thing
as relative deprivation. The idea had not occurred to him and the survey
was not designed to test it. But numbers came out that were so unexpected
and so surprising that it was necessary to invent the idea of relative
deprivation in order to live with them. One of the unexpected findings
was that Northern blacks stationed in the South, despite their resentment
of local racial discrimination, were as well or even better adjusted when
compared to those stationed in the North. Another discrepancy turned up
in the comparative morale of soldiers in units with high promotion&nbsp;<a NAME="166"></a>rates
and those in units with low chances of promotion: the low-promotion group
was the happiest.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>One
parsimonious concept, relative deprivation, fit both of these situations.
The black soldiers stationed in the South compared themselves to the black
civilians they saw around them and found themselves better off. The high-promotion
units had more soldiers who saw others being promoted and therefore felt
more dissatisfaction at not getting ahead than soldiers in units where
no one got ahead.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>When
the apparent discrepancies turned up, did the analysts shout "Eureka" and
appreciate their importance in the history of social science? No. Instead,
they delayed the report, went over the numbers again and again, hoping
that some clerical error or something would show that the black soldiers
and the low-promotion soldiers were not so happy after all. There is a
moral here for journalists. We are not charged with the awesome responsibility
of making original scientific discovery. We do have the responsibility
of challenging and testing the conventional wisdom. And if the conventional
wisdom says one thing and our data say another, we should, if the data
are well and truly collected and analyzed, believe our data.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Rosenberg
also has an answer for the methodological purists who say that after-the-fact
interpretation is too much like Ptolemaic epicycle building. Accidental
discoveries, he points out, are nullifiable. If you find something surprising,
you can use your contingency tables to creep up on it from another direction
to see if it is still there. Stouffer found something surprising in the
attitude of black soldiers, invented the concept, and then tested it elsewhere
in his data on the high- and low-promotion units.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>A
journalistic example is also available. When the Knight Newspapers surveyed
Berkeley arrestees five years after the arrests one of the interesting
findings was that females who had been radicalized by the Sproul Hall affair
tended to hold on to that radicalization more than did males in the ensuing
years. This finding, based on one table, led to the hypothesis that for
a girl to become a radical involves a more traumatic separation from the
values and attitudes of her family than it&nbsp;<a NAME="167"></a>does
for a male, and that she therefore holds on to the radical movement as
a family substitute. The theory was testable from other data in the survey.
If it were true, females should have a greater proportion of parents who
disapproved of the activity that led to their getting arrested. Furthermore,
those females with disapproving parents should be more likely to retain
their radicalism.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Checking
these two propositions required a new two-way table (sex by parent approval)
and a three-way table (radical retention by parental approval by sex) and
one trip to the computing center. It turned out that there was a small
sex difference (though not statistically significant) in favor of males
having parental approval. However, the effect of disapproving parents on
radical retention was the same for boys and girls. So the theory was, for
the purposes of this project at least, nullified.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>"The
post-factum interpretation," says Rosenberg, "is thus not the completion
of the analysis but only the first step in it. The interpretation is made
conditional upon the presence of other evidence to support it."<a NAME="6return8" href="Chapter6.htm#6-8"></a><sup><a href="Chapter6.htm#6-8" name="6return8">8</a></sup></font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Thus
it is not necessary to fall back on a journalistic excuse for using the
computer as a searching device instead of a hypothesis-testing tool. The
journalistic excuse would be that we are in too much of a hurry to be as
precise as sociologists, and, besides, our findings are not going to be
engraved on tablets of stone. Let us think twice before copping out like
that. If we were really backed up against the wall in a methodological
argument with scientific purists, we might have to take that last-resort
position. Meanwhile, we can make the better argument that we are practical
people, just as most sociologists are practical people, and therefore,
when we spot the germ of an idea glimmering in our data, we need not shrink
from its hot pursuit.</font></font>
