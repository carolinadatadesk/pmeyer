<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>The
original <i>Precision Journalism</i> was written in the 1969-1970 academic
year while I was the happy guest of the Russell Sage Foundation in New
York City. It was updated only once, in 1978. The principles of social
science research have not changed very much since then, but the technology
has. And so this book is an attempt at a new start.</font></font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>It
has a new title because 90 percent of the material is new. Only one chapter,
the present chapter 6, has been retained in anything like the original
form. A number of the original anecdotes and examples have been preserved,
but the overall approach has been made kinder, gentler, and, I hope, more
logical, informed by sixteen semesters of teaching this material to journalism
students.</font></font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>The
concept of precision journalism is, as often happens in social science,
much older than the term itself. For a long time, those of us working with
the concept struggled over what to call it. My involvement began in 1966-1967
when I used my Nieman year at Harvard University to study social science
research methods. In the summer of 1967, I applied those methods to coverage
of the Detroit riot for the <i>Detroit Free Press.</i> The Russell Sage
grant followed. It was to produce a manuscript with the working title "The
Application of Social and Behavioral Science Research Methods to the Practice
of Journalism." A proper title had still not been found when the manuscript
saw its first classroom use: Ted Frederickson and Herbert Strentz produced
photocopies with my blessing for students at the University of North Dakota.</font></font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>In
the winter of 1971, Everette E. Dennis took a leave from Kansas State University
to teach a seminar on "The New Journalism" at the University of Oregon.
He included what I had done in Detroit as an example of one rather exotic
species of new journalism, and he called it "precision journalism" to contrast
its scientific method with the artsy approach of those like Tom Wolfe and
Jimmy Breslin who used short-story techniques to illuminate nonfiction.
I first heard the term at K-State from Dennis himself while we were strolling
from the old part of Kedzie Hall to the new. Its earliest uses in print
that I know about date from 1971. Neil Felgenhauer wrote a chapter on precision
journalism in <i>The Magic Writing Machine,</i> a book produced by Dennis's
seminar and published by the University of Oregon School of Journalism.
In that same year, Michael L. Johnson used the term in <i>The New Journalism,</i>
published by the University Press of Kansas, in a footnote to describe
the work of Ben Wattenburg.</font></font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>In
1972, when John Gallman of Indiana University Press broke my string of
rejections and accepted the manuscript for publication, we decided that
Dennis's descriptive term had the right ring, and so we adopted it. The
choice proved to be correct. In the information age, an idea that won't
fit in a sound bite or on a bumper sticker has a poor chance of survival.</font></font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>The
current volume was made possible by the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill and the William Rand Kenan Jr. Professorship, which provided
the funding for a leave of absence. Consulting assignments with <i>USA
Today</i> and CBS News gave me the opportunity to test the ideas on real
journalists. Portions of the manuscript were commented on by Carol Knopes,
Shawn McIntosh, Jim Norman, Larry Sanders, Julia D. Wallace, G. Cleveland
Wilhoit, and Frances Wilhoit. Gordon Black, Robert Hurd, Kathy Frankovic,
and Warren Mitofsky helped me stay current on the art and science of election
polling. The founders of the Carolina Poll, Richard Cole, Robert L. Stevenson,
and Jane Brown, welcomed me into their midst in 1981 and kept my skills
from getting rusty. Robert R. Berry, Pama, Mitchell and Timothy Rogers
were energetic research assistants. Errors are, of course, my own, and
if I didn't get it right this time, I'll try again.</font></font></font></td>
