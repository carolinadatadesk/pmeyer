<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>The original <i>Precision Journalism</i>
was written in the 1969-1970 academic year while I was the happy guest
of the Russell Sage Foundation in New York City. It was updated only once,
in 1978. The principles of social science research have not changed very
much since then, but the technology has. And so this book is an attempt
at a new start.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>It has a new title because 90 percent
of the material is new. Only one chapter, the present chapter 6, has been
retained in anything like the original form. A number of the original anecdotes
and examples have been preserved, but the overall approach has been made
kinder, gentler, and, I hope, more logical, informed by sixteen semesters
of teaching this material to journalism students.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>The concept of precision journalism
is, as often happens in social science, much older than the term itself.
For a long time, those of us working with the concept struggled over what
to call it. My involvement began in 1966-1967 when I used my Nieman year
at Harvard University to study social science research methods. In the
summer of 1967, I applied those methods to coverage of the Detroit riot
for the <i>Detroit Free Press.</i> The Russell Sage grant followed. It
was to produce a manuscript with the working title "The Application of
Social and Behavioral Science Research Methods to the Practice of Journalism."
A proper title had still not been found when the manuscript saw its first
classroom use: Ted Frederickson and Herbert Strentz produced photocopies
with my blessing for students at the University of North Dakota.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>In the winter of 1971, Everette
E. Dennis took a leave from Kansas State University to teach a seminar
on "The New Journalism" at the University of Oregon. He included what I
had done in Detroit as an example of one rather exotic species of new journalism,
and he called it "precision journalism" to contrast its scientific method
with the artsy approach of those like Tom Wolfe and Jimmy Breslin who used
short-story techniques to illuminate nonfiction. I first heard the term
at K-State from Dennis himself while we were strolling from the old part
of Kedzie Hall to the new. Its earliest uses in print that I know about
date from 1971. Neil Felgenhauer wrote a chapter on precision journalism
in <i>The Magic Writing Machine,</i> a book produced by Dennis's seminar
and published by the University of Oregon School of Journalism. In that
same year, Michael L. Johnson used the term in <i>The New Journalism,</i>
published by the University Press of Kansas, in a footnote to describe
the work of Ben Wattenburg.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>In 1972, when John Gallman of Indiana
University Press broke my string of rejections and accepted the manuscript
for publication, we decided that Dennis's descriptive term had the right
ring, and so we adopted it. The choice proved to be correct. In the information
age, an idea that won't fit in a sound bite or on a bumper sticker has
a poor chance of survival.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>The current volume was made possible
by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the William Rand
Kenan Jr. Professorship, which provided the funding for a leave of absence.
Consulting assignments with <i>USA Today</i> and CBS News gave me the opportunity
to test the ideas on real journalists. Portions of the manuscript were
commented on by Carol Knopes, Shawn McIntosh, Jim Norman, Larry Sanders,
Julia D. Wallace, G. Cleveland Wilhoit, and Frances Wilhoit. Gordon Black,
Robert Hurd, Kathy Frankovic, and Warren Mitofsky helped me stay current
on the art and science of election polling. The founders of the Carolina
Poll, Richard Cole, Robert L. Stevenson, and Jane Brown, welcomed me into
their midst in 1981 and kept my skills from getting rusty. Robert R. Berry,
Pama, Mitchell and Timothy Rogers were energetic research assistants. Errors
are, of course, my own, and if I didn't get it right this time, I'll try
again.</font></font></td>
