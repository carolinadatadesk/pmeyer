<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Journalism
and the Scientific Tradition</font></font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If
you are a journalist, or thinking of becoming one, you may have already
noticed this: They are raising the ante on what it takes to be a journalist.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>There
was a time when all it took was a dedication to truth, plenty of energy,
and some talent for writing. You still need those things, but they are
no longer sufficient. The world has become so complicated, the growth of
available information so explosive, that the journalist needs to be a filter
as well as a transmitter, an organizer and interpreter as well as one who
gathers and delivers facts. In addition to knowing how to get information
into print or on the air, he or she also must know how to get it into the
receiver's head. In short, a journalist has to be a database manager, a
data processor, and a data analyst.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>It
takes special training. In the good old days, there was serious doubt in
professional circles about whether journalism, as a discipline, included
any body of knowledge at all. Journalism, in this view, is all procedure,
not substance.<a NAME="conant1" href="Chapter1.htm#note1"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note1" name="conant1">1<a NAME="return1"></a></a></sup>When
James Bryant Conant had to deal with a windfall bequest to Harvard to "improve
the standards of journalism," he chose substantive training for mid-career
journalists. "Mr. Conant felt that there was not a sufficient knowledge
base to justify a journalism school . . . this conclusion led to a remarkably
successful program which we have no desire to alter," Harvard president
Derek Bok recalled fifty years later.<a NAME="return2" href="Chapter1.htm#note2"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note2" name="return2">2</a></sup></font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In
a simpler world, journalism programs that ignored journalism might have
been justified. In the information society, the needs are more complex.
Read any of the popular journals of media criticism and you will find a
long litany of repeated complaints about modern journalism. It misses important
stories, is too dependent on press releases, is easily manipulated by politicians
and special interests, and does not communicate what it does know in an
effective manner. All of these complaints are justified. Their cause is
not so much a lack of energy or talent or dedication to truth, as the critics
sometimes imply, but a simple lag in the application of information science
-- a body of knowledge -- to the daunting problems of reporting the news
in a time of information overload.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Harvard's
Nieman program, which gives selected mid-career journalists an academic
year to repair whatever educational gaps they perceive, is used by some
to broaden their scope as generalists. But more and more are using it to
adapt to the new demands by becoming more specialized. In a world where
the amount of information is doubling every five years,<a NAME="note1.3" href="Chapter1.htm#note3"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note3" name="note1.3">3<a NAME="return3"></a></a></sup>it
takes a specialist to understand, let alone communicate, very much of it.
The journalistic body of knowledge, therefore, must include these elements:</font></font>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>1.
How to find information;</font></font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>2.
How to evaluate and analyze it;</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>3.
How to communicate it in a way that will pierce the babble of information
overload and reach the people who need and want it.</font></font></blockquote>

<div style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1>To the extent that journalists
learn how to do these things, they are meeting one of the elements of a
profession: access to an esoteric body of knowledge. We are learning, and
journalism is becoming more professionalized, but, as with any sweeping
change, it is proceeding unsteadily and at different rates in different
places.</font></div>

<br>&nbsp;

<p style="line-height: 140%"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Where
craft meets theory</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In
journalism schools, the concept of precision journalism -- the application
of social and behavioral science research methods to the practice of journalism
-- found a ready market.&nbsp;<a NAME="3"></a>The ready acceptance of this
concept in academe was due in part to its contribution to the healing of
the breach between the green eyeshade and chi-square factions. It demonstrated
the applicability of social science research methods to the very real problems
of newsgathering in an increasingly complex society. It produced work that
both the researchers and the craft people could appreciate. The tools of
sampling, computer analysis, and statistical inference increased the traditional
power of the reporter without changing the nature of his or her mission
-- to find the facts, to understand them, and to explain them without wasting
time.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In
the profession, however, the barriers were greater. Precision journalism
threatened the twin traditions of journalistic passivity and journalistic
innocence. The former tradition holds that media should report news, not
make news. Media involvement in public opinion polling has been criticized
on the ground that the media should not do polls but should wait passively
until other people do them and then report on them.<a NAME="note1.4" href="Chapter1.htm#note4"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note4" name="note1.4">4<a NAME="return4"></a></a></sup>Media
polls also violate the innocence rule. A reporter should be a person who
casts a fresh eye on everything, something that he or she cannot do if
burdened by too much specialized knowledge. A journalist, Vermont Royster
told the 1967 class of Nieman Fellows, should be "a professional amateur."
The extreme case is a foreign correspondent I once knew who laughed when
I asked him if he was learning the language of the country to which he
was assigned. In his view it was not necessary, might even be a hindrance.
His readers did not know the language, and his job was merely to observe
what they would observe if they were there and report on what he saw. If
he learned a foreign language he might start to think like a foreigner
and lose touch with those readers.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
trouble with being a passive and innocent journalist is that, like any
passive and innocent person, one can be too easily taken advantage of.
The underlying theme in most modern criticism of journalism is that the
media are too easily dominated by powerful politicians and their skillful
"spin doctors" whose desires too easily determine what is defined as news
and what is not. To defend against being manipulated, the media need more
self-confidence, and the best&nbsp;<a NAME="4"></a>route to self-confidence
is through knowledge. Media polls proliferated in the 1980s precisely because
the editors no longer trusted the polls that politicians tried to give
them and armed themselves with their own data-collection operations out
of self-defense. Thus polling became not so much a way to make news as
an enhanced tool of the newsgathering process itself -- provided, of course,
that journalists are in charge of the entire process, from conception,
through research design, to analysis and interpretation. The precision
journalist does not hire a pollster to create a news event; the journalist
becomes the pollster. Jim Norman of <i>USA</i> <i>Today</i>, Rich Morin
of the <i>WashingtonPost</i>, and I. A. (Bud) Lewis of the <i>Los Angeles</i>
<i>Times</i> were among the prototypes.</font></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Beyond
objectivity</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
model of the journalist as passive innocent had at least one virtue: it
provided a kind of discipline. It was consistent with the tradition of
objectivity, a tradition that keeps the journalist from imposing personal
viewpoints on the readers. But the objectivity model was designed for a
simpler world, one where unadorned facts can speak for themselves. Frustration
over the unmet ideal of objectivity led some of the media in the 1960s
to embrace something called the "new journalism," which freed journalists
from the constraints of objectivity by granting them artistic license to
become storytellers. Jimmy Breslin and Tom Wolfe were among the first successful
practitioners, and their methods worked until they reached a point where
they stopped being journalism. The literary tools of fiction, including
exquisite detail, interior monologue (what a newsworthy person is thinking
as well as his or her overt behavior), and short-story structure, with
a character, a problem, and a resolution in a short span of words, can
yield journalistic products that are a joy to read. Unfortunately, the
data-collection process is extremely difficult. To make life appear to
be a short story, one has to be extremely selective, and that requires
gathering a very large number of facts from which to select. The constraints
of daily journalism will not support that level of effort day after day.
Some practitioners of the "new journalism" took to making&nbsp;<a NAME="5"></a>up
their facts in order to keep up with the deadline pressures. Others stopped
short of making things up, but combined facts from different cases to write
composite portrayals of reality that they passed off as real cases.<a NAME="return5" href="Chapter1.htm#note5"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note5" name="return5">5</a></sup></font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Despite
the problems, the new nonfiction remains an interesting effort at coping
with information complexity and finding a way to communicate essential
truth. It pushes journalism toward art. Its problem is that journalism
requires discipline, and the discipline of art may not be the most appropriate
kind. A better solution is to push journalism toward science, incorporating
both the powerful data-gathering and analysis tools of science and its
disciplined search for verifiable truth.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><a NAME="lippmann5"></a><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>This
is not a new idea. Walter Lippmann noted seventy years ago that journalism
depends on the availability of objectifiable fact. "The more points, then,
at which any happening can be fixed, objectified, measured, named, the
more points there are at which news can occur."<a NAME="return6" href="Chapter1.htm#note6"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note6" name="return6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;
Scientific method offers a way to make happenings objectified, measured,
and named.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;

<p style="line-height: 140%"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Journalism
as science</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>You
might think that scientists would object to such an effort as an absurd
pretension on the part of journalists. Not so. The first publication of
<i>Precision Journalism</i> in 1973 was made possible by a foundation devoted
to the support of the social sciences. In 1989, physicist Lawrence Cranberg
argued that "journalism itself is a science, and . . . a properly qualified,
responsible journalist is a practicing scientist." Both scientists and
journalists, he said, "march to the same orders and serve the common need
of mankind for shared knowledge and understanding."<a NAME="return7" href="Chapter1.htm#note7"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note7" name="return7">7</a></sup></font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><a NAME="journalismschools5"></a><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If
journalists would only admit that shared responsibility, Cranberg said,
it would clear the way for better training in investigative methods, less
tolerance for superstition (astrology was a dead issue until newspapers
revived it after World War I), and a commitment to a more rational and
peaceful social order. Journalists are so steeped in the ideal of objectivity
and open-mindedness that any kind of statement of&nbsp;<a NAME="6"></a>social
goals is likely to make us uneasy, even when the goals are as benign as
reducing superstition and building a more rational society. But the plea
for more powerful tools of investigation resonates well with us. Fact-finding
ability is, after all, the source of what power we possess.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Yet
another benefit of a scientific approach to journalism, not mentioned by
Cranberg, ought to sit well with most of us. The information sciences are
now sufficiently developed so that we can give some systematic attention
to the forms of the messages we prepare and the best ways to compose and
send them so that they will be received and understood. This body of knowledge
enables us to find out how to get messages into the heads of the audience,
not just their hands. Courses in the processes and effects of mass communication
had become standard in the better journalism schools by the 1960s. And
by the 1980s, leaders in industry could see the need for getting down to
such basics. James K. Batten, chief executive officer of Knight-Ridder
Inc. told the story of an otherwise promising young journalist who failed
to get hired at the prestigious newspaper group after he disdainfully declared
in the job interview that he wrote to please himself, not the readers.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>"Over
the years, we've all hired people like him -- and made our newspapers less
reader-centered in the process," Batten said. "The time has come to stop.
And our allies in the colleges and universities who educate young journalists
need to understand that truth -- and send us people with an eagerness to
reach out to readers."<a NAME="return8" href="Chapter1.htm#note8"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note8" name="return8">8</a></sup></font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
new precision journalism is scientific journalism. (In France, the term
"precision journalism" has been translated as "le journalisme scientifique.")
It means treating journalism as if it were a science, adopting scientific
method, scientific objectivity, and scientific ideals to the entire process
of mass communication. If that sounds absurdly pretentious, remember that
science itself is restrained about its achievements and its possibilities
and has its own sanctions against pretension. "There are always hidden
facts, and truths are elusive in every domain of human inquiry," Cranberg
the physicist wrote. "What is needed to discover hidden facts and arrive
at elusive truths is a skilled determination to get at&nbsp;<a NAME="7"></a>them,
and that is a determination that is as appropriate to a properly trained
journalist as to a properly trained physicist."</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Starting
in the 1970s, journalism began moving toward a more scientific stance along
two separate paths. The increasing availability of computers made large
bodies of data available to journalists in a way that was not possible
before. And in the business office, the failure of newspaper circulation
to keep up with the growth in number of households made publishers pay
more systematic attention to the marketplace and the factors that motivated
readers to spend time and money with the publishers' products. The notion
that a newspaper is a product and that a reader is a rational creature
who makes a choice about whether to pay the cost of using the product became
respectable. And so market forces were pushing journalism as a whole, not
just a few isolated players in the field, to a more scientific stance.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Progress
always has its detractors and nonbelievers. As recently as 1989, at a summit
conference of newspaper people bent on discovering the causes of readership
loss, an editor of a metropolitan newspaper still publicly denounced the
main finding of two decades of readership surveys: that the most frequent
reason for not reading the paper is lack of time. "I don't buy it," he
said, arguing that if newspapers would just do a better job of providing
their fundamental services, like getting the paper delivered on time, things
would be better.<a NAME="return9" href="Chapter1.htm#note9"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note9" name="return9">9</a></sup>
His was not an isolated view, and a lot of research reports have been written
in the effort to explain what "no time to read" really means. Christine
Urban, speaking to the American Newspaper Publishers Association in 1986,
had the best answer. What the readers are telling us, she said, is "Watch
my lips -- I don't have the time to read the paper every day."<a NAME="return10" href="Chapter1.htm#note10"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note10" name="return10">10</a></sup>&nbsp;
In the hustle and babble of the information age, the cost in time of extracting
information from a journalist's report has to be one of the considerations
in the preparation of that report. <i>USA Today's</i> contribution in the
1980s was that it showed how a newspaper could be positioned as a saver
of time. It did this by editing and formatting the newspaper with such
care and precision that it could meet the reader's need for surveillance
-- scanning the world for personal dangers&nbsp;<a NAME="8"></a>and opportunities
-- with a minimum commitment of time. It delivered data that had been extensively
-- and expensively -- processed.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;

<p style="line-height: 140%"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>What
to do with data</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Knowing
what to do with data is the essence of the new precision journalism. The
problem may be thought of as having two phases: the input phase, where
data are collected and analyzed, and the output phase, where the data are
prepared for entry into the reader's mind. This book is mostly about the
first phase, but the two are so intertwined that it will also deal to some
degree with the output side.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
main goal of what follows will be to tell you how to do these things with
data:</font></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>1.
<i>Collect it.</i> Whether or not you ever try to emulate scientists in
their data-collection methods, you can profit from knowing some of their
tricks. It is always worth remembering, as Professor H. Douglas Price told
me at Harvard in the spring of 1967, that "data do not come from the stork."</font></font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>2.
<i>Store it. </i>Old-time journalists store data on stacks of paper on
their desks, in corners of their offices, and, if they are really well
organized, in clip-files. Computers are better.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>3.
<i>Retrieve it.</i> The tools of precision journalism can help you retrieve
data that you collected and stored yourself, data that someone else stored
with a user like you in mind, or data that someone else stored for reasons
completely unrelated to your interest, perhaps with no earthly idea that
a journalist or public user would ever be interested in it.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>4.
<i>Analyze it.</i> Journalistic analysis often consists of merely sorting
to find and list the interesting deviances. But it can also involve searches
for implied causation, for patterns that suggest that different phenomena
vary together for interesting reasons.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>5.
<i>Reduce it.</i> Data reduction has become as important a skill in journalism
as data collection. A good news story is defined by what it leaves out
as well as what it includes.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>6.
<i>Communicate it. </i>A report unread or not understood is a report wasted.
You can make a philosophical case that, like the sound of a tree falling
in the forest, it does not exist at all.</font></font></blockquote>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>On
a spring morning, running along a misty Chapel Hill street, I topped a
low hill and saw in the distance a crouched yellow figure about 18 inches
high. It appeared tense, ready to spring, fangs bared, aiming for a point
along my path ahead. As I got closer and my eyes were able to resolve the
figure more clearly, I saw it for what it really was: an ordinary fireplug.
The image of the dog had been the creation of my own brain, imposing an
order and a pattern of its own on the ambiguous data relayed by the eyes.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Raw
data alone can never be enough. To be useful, to be understood, data have
to be processed, abstracted, fit into some kind of structure. You have
to put the material into a mental framework that aids in interpretation
and understanding. This truism applies equally to the data of everyday
perception and to strings of numbers in computers. To think about them
at all, you need a perceptual framework. If you don't provide one consciously,
then your unconscious mind, perhaps driven by anxiety like that of a jogger
in a neighborhood of dog owners, may provide the wrong one for you.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Different
writers in different fields have given different names to these perceptual
structures.&nbsp; Psychologists sometimes call them "schema." They are
also known as constructs, hypotheses, expectations, organizing principles,
frames, scripts, plans, prototypes, or even (this one from psychology)
"implicational molecules."<a NAME="return11" href="Chapter1.htm#note11"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note11" name="return11">11</a></sup>
Walter Lippmann called them "stereotypes."<a NAME="return12" href="Chapter1.htm#note12"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note12" name="return12">12</a></sup>&nbsp;
In general, he said, "the way we see things is a combination of what is
there and what we expected to find. The heavens are not the same to an
astronomer as to a pair of lovers . . . the Tahitian belle is a better
looking person to her Tahitian suitor than to the readers of the <i>National

And whether you see a dog or a fireplug depends on what you expect to see.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In
its most sophisticated and conscious form, the schema, construct, or stereotype
becomes a theoretical model. A formal model describes the essential parts

from the model to be tested by experiment or by observation or both. But
in most cases, our use of models or constructs is not&nbsp;<a NAME="10"></a>that
sophisticated and not that careful. We use them simply because we need
them to think at all. The data of everyday life, left unfitted to any model,
take too much effort to process and interpret in the raw. Our senses take
in too much of it.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;

<p style="line-height: 140%"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Testing
the model</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
problem with theoretical models --&nbsp;</font><font size=-1> </font><font size=+1>both
the everyday kind and the formal ones of science -- is that we tend to
get stuck with them. Two national studies of newspaper credibility published
in 1985 and 1986 offer an example. One study (we'll call it Study Y for
now) showed that 53 percent of the public believed that news organizations
favor one side when presenting news dealing with political and social issues
while only 34 percent thought the media are fair to all sides. And by 73
to 21 percent, most thought news organizations often invade peoples' privacy.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
other study (Study X) asked about the same issues with a five-point scale,
and it showed that by 52 to 10 percent, more people called newspapers fair
than unfair. And the public was about evenly split on the privacy issue:
32 percent thought newspapers invade privacy and 30 percent thought they
respected privacy. The two studies were conducted only six months apart,
between December 1984 and May 1985.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>As
you might expect, one was presented as a "good news" study full of optimism
about public attitudes toward the media. The other resulted in a report
full of gloom and foreboding. Now here's the surprise: the sunny report
was written by the people who produced Study Y, the one with the unfavorable
attitudes cited above. And the gloomy report was based on the numbers in
Study X, the one that found that most people trust newspapers.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Did
the wires in the computer get crossed? No. The two research groups were
working from different schema. Study X was sponsored by the credibility
committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Its chairman, David
Lawrence, wanted to use the study as shock therapy to awaken editors to
a problem and stir them to action.<a NAME="return14" href="Chapter1.htm#note14"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note14" name="return14">14</a></sup>&nbsp;
Study Y was&nbsp;<a NAME="11"></a>sponsored by Times Mirror, which wanted
some corporate visibility and a chance to make some news. Publishing findings
"which run counter to the conventional wisdom" is a good way to do that.<a NAME="return15" href="Chapter1.htm#note15"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note15" name="return15">15</a></sup></font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Both
groups of researchers meant to tell the truth, but whether they saw a dog
or a fireplug depended on the schema with which they approached the inquiry.
To the journalist trained in objectivity, it may seem that the problem
was in starting with any structural framework at all. The journalistic
ideal is to be open-minded, to enter an investigation with a clean slate,
free of any prejudgment. Having a hypothesis seems a lot like being prejudiced.
That view, while well-intentioned, is not practical. You can't begin to
think about a problem without some kind of theoretical framework. And you
will have one, whether you are conscious of it or not. The process of hypothesis
formulation in scientific method forces the framework to the conscious
level where it can be coldly and objectively evaluated.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Now
it is true that there is some danger that the evaluation will not be cold
and objective enough. The two newspaper studies cited above are a good
illustration. The cure for that problem is not to abandon the process of
hypothesis-making but to state your hypothesis and evaluate it in full
public view so that other investigators can check on your work. Both the
Times Mirror and the ASNE researchers did just that. No long-term harm
was done, because both left a paper trail that described their method,
their findings, and the route to their conclusions. Even better, they made
their data available for secondary analysis by other scholars. Their publications
stimulated much analysis and discussion about the next step in understanding
the peculiar relationship between a news medium and its readers, listeners,
or viewers. One of the characteristics of science is that it is always
subject to such checking and rechecking. That is one of the lessons from
the case of the two credibility studies. The other is that it is extremely
important to give careful thought to the theoretical structure with which
one approaches a problem and to appreciate the consequences of the choice
of a schematic model.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;

<p style="line-height: 140%"><a NAME="12"></a><b><font face="arial, palatino"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Reality
testing</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Once
you choose a model, you may be stuck with it for a long time. A model that
works well enough for the purpose at hand soon becomes comfortable, like
an old shoe, and is given up reluctantly. Inappropriate models, clung to
after their usefulness is gone, are the source of superstition, conventional
wisdom, and closed minds. Herbert Butterfield, the historian of modern
science, has argued that the development of new models was more important
in the creation of modern physics than the collection of new data. A successful
scientist needs "the art of handling the same bundle of data as before,
but placing them in a new system of relations with one another by giving
them a different framework, all of which virtually means putting on a different
kind of thinking-cap for the moment."<a NAME="return16" href="Chapter1.htm#note16"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note16" name="return16">16</a></sup>&nbsp;
Modern scientific method provides an incentive to put on that different
thinking cap by prompting a continual testing of the old models and a perpetual
search for better ones. Aristotle, whose model for the mechanics of motion
held that a moving body continued on a given path only so long as something
was pushing it, was wrong. And yet his model was the dominant one for centuries,
partly because science was not yet conditioned to challenge and to experiment.
(One problem encumbering Aristotle and his Greek contemporaries was the
sharp distinction between philosophers and working people. To actually
conduct an experiment would involve getting one's hands dirty. This disinclination
to do more than think persisted even to the time of Galileo, who preferred
"thought experiments" to the real thing.)</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Modern
scientific method provides for aggressive reality testing. Journalists
are interested in testing reality, too. The main difference -- beyond the
obvious one that journalists are in more of a hurry -- is that journalists
are more passive about it. Instead of testing reality directly with their
own observations, deductions, and experiments, they are normally content
to do their cross-checking by consulting different authorities with different
viewpoints and different interests. The flaw in this methodology is that
the journalist may not have any good basis for evaluating the conflicting
sources and may be forced into the traditional objectivist stance which&nbsp;<a NAME="13"></a>demands
the unlikely assumption that all voices have an equal claim to the truth.
The journalist who adapts the tools of scientific method to his or her
own trade can be in a position to make useful evaluations with the more
powerful objectivity of science.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Journalists
already share some of the characteristics of scientists, often without
knowing it. Among them:</font></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>1.<i>
Skepticism. </i>"If your mother says she loves you, check it out," is an
aphorism from the culture of journalism, not science, but it fits both
equally well. Neither journalists nor scientists are content to rest with
what popular opinion or authority claims is true. Truth is always tentative,
always has room for sharpening and improvement.</font></font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>2.
<i>Openness. </i>The key word is "replicability." A good investigative
reporter documents his search for truth, making a paper trail that other
investigators can follow to reach the same conclusions.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>3.
<i>An instinct for operationalization.</i> To test a model, a scientist
thinks about the processes that the model represents and where they lead.
Then he or she looks for a place in the observable world where aspects
of that process can be measured in a way that will confirm or refute the
model. That process of finding the observable and testable piece is called
operationalization. Both scientists and investigative journalists depend
on it. The confirmation of a theory is its power to predict the results
of an operational measurement.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>4.
<i>A sense of the tentativeness of truth.</i> In the ancient argument between
absolutism and relativism, science is more comfortable with relativism.
The truths that it discovers are welcomed when they improve our understanding
or our technology, but with the recognition that they might be replaced
by stronger truths in the future. This concept is not an easy one for journalists,
whose quest for simplicity and certainty makes absolutism appealing.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>5.
<i>Parsimony. </i>Given a choice between rival theories, we generally prefer
the simpler one. The best theory explains the most with the least. The
Copernican theory of the universe prevailed over the older system of&nbsp;<a NAME="14"></a>Ptolemy
because it was simpler. In order to account for the motion of the planets,
Ptolemy proposed a system of "epicycles" in which each planet moved in
orbits within orbits around the earth. As instrumentation got better, astronomers
detected movements that the theory could not explain unless more epicycles
within epicycles were postulated. Putting the sun at the center of the
system eliminated the need for epicycles.</font></font></blockquote>

<div style="line-height: 140%"></div>

<p><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>The
importance of humility</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>It
is ironic that journalistic defense of the First Amendment today is often
argued from an absolutist position. The eighteenth century political thought
underlying the constitution of the United States, particularly the First
Amendment, is based on a rejection of absolutism. In the dawn of the scientific
era, the futility of compelling any particular belief was clear because
new data or a new interpretation of old data was always arising to challenge
the old beliefs. And so it made sense to be tolerant of unorthodox beliefs
and to protect them under the basic law of the land. Today's heresy could
be tomorrow's wisdom.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>So
a little bit of humility is good for everyone, but especially for scientists
and journalists. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes noted that what we think
of as truths might better be called "can't helps":</font></font>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Arial, helvetica"><font size=+0>When
I say that a thing is true, I mean that I cannot help believing it. . .
. But . . . I do not venture to assume that my inabilities in the way of
thought are inabilities of the universe. I therefore define truth as the
system of my limitations, and leave absolute truth for those who are better
equipped. . . . Certitude is not the test of certainty. We have been cock-sure
of many things that were not so.<a NAME="return17" href="Chapter1.htm#note17"></a></font></font><sup><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=-1><a href="Chapter1.htm#note17" name="return17">17</a></font></font></sup></div>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>This
unpretentiousness can give the scientist and the journalist a certain freedom.
You do not have to wait to verify that you have found certain, absolute,
unassailable truth before sharing the finding. If you have made a mistake,
and been open about the process that led you to it, someone else will discover
it and publish, and the cause of truth will have been advanced another
notch. Democratic pluralism, which&nbsp;<a NAME="15"></a>lets truth emerge
from the combat of many voices, is a good environment for both scientist
and journalist.</font></font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>One
of the advantages of adopting a theoretical model for journalistic use
is that it keeps you and your readers focused on the relevant. Much information
in public affairs is arcane and complicated. The journalist who becomes
an expert in the field being covered can quickly lose the way in irrelevant
detail.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>My
first major investigative story as a newspaper reporter was about wasteful
purchasing of fire and windstorm insurance on school buildings in Dade
County, Florida. Under the plan then in effect, the insurance program was
controlled by an agent whose compensation was a share of the commissions.
The more insurance cost, the more money he made. Debates at school board
meetings on the subject were obscure in their detail and impossible to
follow. In frustration, the superintendent of schools asked his board for
a $10,000 study to resolve the technical complexities. The request was
tabled and eventually died.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>What
was needed to understand the situation was a theoretical model that could
be operationalized. Mine was a basic log-rolling or mutual back-scratching
model. It led to the following hypotheses:</font></font>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>1.
The insurance servicing agent's self-dealing would make insurance more
costly than for similar bodies without such a conflict of interest.</font></font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>2.
If the board goes along with this cost, its members must be receiving something
of value: for example, the power to reward their friends in the insurance
business.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>3.
If they are rewarding their friends, board members must again get something
in return.</font></font></blockquote>

<div style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1>Each of those propositions
is simple. You don't need a detailed understanding of the insurance business
or its regulation to grasp any of them. And each could be operationalized.</font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
first proposition was tested by comparing property insurance costs of the
Dade County schools with those of the Metropolitan Government of Dade County,
a separate political unit with the same geographic definition.&nbsp;<a NAME="16"></a>The
Metropolitan Government costs, per dollar of building value, were a third
those of the Dade County Schools. Moreover, the loss ratio for school insurance
was quite low by industry standards. Over the long history of the program,
only 15 percent of the premium money had gone back to the school system
in claims.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Direct
questioning of the school board members and the benefiting insurance agents
verified that the system had the earmarks of political patronage. To keep
the other insurance agents in the community happy with the system, the
school system's servicing agent shared a portion of his commissions with
them. School board members decided how this sharing would be allocated.
Now all that was needed was to close the logical loop by showing that board
members got something in return.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Florida
pioneered in election reporting laws, and each member's campaign contributions
were on file at the courthouse. Each entry showed a donor's name, the candidate's
name, and a dollar amount. Confirmation of the third hypothesis required
a link between the donors and the insurance business. There were 181 agencies
participating in the school insurance program. From an industry directory
I got the names of their officers and made a card index, one name per card,
and alphabetized it. Then I checked each name on the campaign contributor
lists against the card index. Bingo! Insurance people were important contributors
to all five of the school board members who had run in the previous election.
The chairman of the board received 65 percent of his total contributions
from insurance people. Two others got more than half from the same sources.
The resulting three-part series led the local page.<a NAME="return18" href="Chapter1.htm#note18"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note18" name="return18">18</a></sup>
The school board quickly reformed the system and eventually gave teachers
a raise with the money that was saved.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>A
reporter working on such a story today would, of course, use a computer
instead of three-by-five index cards to check out the names. But the mechanics
are less important than the concept. A model that points you to the relevant
facts and suggests an operationalization is far more important in increasing
your power as a reporter than the machine&nbsp;<a NAME="17"></a>that does
the clerical part. The machines do make things possible that could not
be done before, but to get the most out of them, we need to think the way
that scientists think, building the models that enable us to use the new
computing power.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Journalists
tend to be practical people, and as such we are sometimes too quick to
scorn people who deal in what seems to us to be empty theory lacking in
any real-world application. But without theory, we have nothing but unordered
raw data, and we suffocate in it. The computer can alphabetize it for us,
it can give us lists ordered by any dimension found in the data, but we
still have to have a theory to give the list a point.</font></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Sources
of theories</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Where
do theories come from? The range of sources is broad, from folklore to
the products of the most creative and sophisticated minds in science. A
good theory is one that has consequences that can be tested and used as
building blocks for more discoveries and more theories. Science is as dependent
on openness as journalism is.&nbsp; Michael Polyani, a chemist who worked
at the dawn of the nuclear age, compared the scientific process to a group
of workers assembling a giant jigsaw puzzle. A group can't do it efficiently
unless each member knows what the other members are doing. "Let them work
on putting the puzzle together in the sight of the others, so that every
time a piece of it is fitted in by one, all the others will immediately
watch out for the next step that becomes possible in consequence," he said.<a NAME="return19" href="Chapter1.htm#note19"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note19" name="return19">19</a></sup>
The methodology of journalists covering public affairs is exactly the same,
even if the process is less self-conscious. Reporters, like scientists,
are in the business of reality testing, examining the existing theories,
thinking through their consequences, developing related hypotheses that
can be operationalized (i.e., tested), and putting them to the test.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;

<p style="line-height: 140%"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>The
case of the Detroit riot</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Periods
of social upheaval offer especially good opportunities for testing theories.
When the race riots of the 1960s began, first in the Watts area of Los
Angeles, then in Newark&nbsp;<a NAME="18"></a>and Detroit, there were several
popular theories to explain the cause. One theory, popular with editorial
writers, was that the rioters were the most frustrated and hopeless cases
at the bottom of the economic ladder who rioted because they had no other
means of advancement or expression. This theory can be tested with survey
research. If you can identify the rioters and compare them with the non-rioters,
you will find, if the theory is true, that the less-educated are more likely
to be riot participants. The <i>DetroitFreePress</i> did perform such a
survey in 1967, and found that people who had attended college were just
as likely to participate in the riot as those who had failed to finish
high school. The theory was not supported by the data.<a NAME="return20" href="Chapter1.htm#note20"></a></font></font><sup><font face="Palatino"><a href="Chapter1.htm#note20" name="return20">20</a></font></sup>&nbsp;

<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Another
opportunity came after the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968.
The immediately popular theory was that his nonviolent movement died with
him and that&nbsp;<a NAME="19"></a>blacks would turn for leadership to
the advocates of violence. The <i>MiamiHerald</i>, which had done an attitude
survey among its black population before the assassination, went back to
the same respondents and found that King's ideals were stronger than ever.<a NAME="return21" href="Chapter1.htm#note21"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note21" name="return21">21</a></sup></font></font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Race
relations has proved a fertile field for journalistic reality testing more
recently. Pulitzer prizes were won for stories published in the <i>Dallas
Morning</i> <i>News</i> in 1985 and the <i>Atlanta Constitution&nbsp;<a NAME="ref1.1"></a></i>in
1988 that showed how federal government programs were being used to perpetuate
racial discrimination. The Texas case involved segregation in public housing.
The Atlanta story documented discrimination in federally insured mortgage
lending. Both projects relied on computer analysis of large government
databases. Both started with a theoretical framework: a government with
a commitment to racial equality should produce measurable results that
would reflect that equality. Measurement and analysis showed that, in reality,
the results of government programs did not reflect equality.<a NAME="return22" href="Chapter1.htm#note22"></a><sup><a href="Chapter1.htm#note22" name="return22">22</a></sup>
To decide what to measure, the reporters had to have a theory and an operational
hypothesis. In other words, they were thinking like scientists.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Here
is what Julia D. Wallace, <i>USA Today</i> managing editor for special
projects, had to say after her first few months of wrestling with precision
journalism: "I guess the bottom line here is it is going to take more to
be a journalist in the future. It's not enough to have writing ability,
good sources, and lots of energy. Reporters and editors are going to need
to know something about statistics and software.</font></font>
