love field experiments. When I was a young reporter in Miami, a wise but
slightly daffy feature editor named Bill Phillips sent me out into the
streets to test the tolerance of Miamians for boorish behavior. I bumped
into hurrying businessmen, I blew smoke into the faces of sweet old ladies,
I tied up traffic at a bus stop by spilling a handful of change in a bus
doorway and insisting on picking up every last nickel before the bus could
move. The reaction of the citizenry was kind and gentle, and I dare any
<i>Miami
Herald</i> reporter to replicate that experiment today.<a NAME="7return1" href="Chapter7.htm#7-1"></a><a NAME="7return1" href="Chapter7.htm#7-1"></a><sup><a href="Chapter7.htm#7-1" name="7return1">1</a></sup>
On April Fool's Day, Phillips stationed me at the corner of Miami Avenue
and Flagler Street with a string attached to a purse lying on the sidewalk,
so that I could snatch it out of the way of any passerby foolish enough
to try to pick it up. A photographer hid in a nearby doorway to record
the number of times I got punched in the nose. That's another experiment
nobody has dared to replicate.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

like these may not be worth turning into generalizable experiments, but
there are socially useful and interesting things to be done that have both
some degree of generalizability and the mad ring of 1950s <i>Miami Herald</i>
copy. Some examples:</font></font><o:p></o:p>
<br></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><b><font face="arial, helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Ignorance

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In
1988, Dr. Inge Corless, a faculty member in the health sciences division
of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was preparing a course
on Acquired Immune&nbsp;<a NAME="169"></a>Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). As
part of her research, she discussed with local pharmacists the disease-prevention
properties of different types of condoms and discovered a disturbing lack
of knowledge among these professionals. To see if her findings were true
of a larger group of pharmacists, my advanced reporting class designed
an experiment. A team of students sent one of its members to every pharmacy
in Chapel Hill and the neighboring town of Carrboro to buy condoms and
ask the pharmacist's advice about the best kind for preventing AIDS. A
cumulative scale was designed to rank each pharmacist on how much he or
she knew. The scale is cumulative because anyone who knows any given fact
on the list usually knows the preceding facts as well:</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>1.
Latex is better than animal skin (pores in the latter can admit the virus).</font></font>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>2.
Lubricated latex is better than dry latex (less danger of breaking).</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>3.
Lubrication with a spermicide is better than plain lubrication (the spermicide
can kill the AIDS virus).</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>4.
The name of the spermicide that kills the AIDS virus in laboratory test
is Nonoxynol-9.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Only
40 percent of the pharmacists knew all of these simple facts. Worse yet,
some of them advised the student buyers to buy the lambskin condoms, which
are both the most expensive and the least effective in preventing AIDS.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>This
was a simple and easily generalizable field experiment, for several reasons.
First, no inferences about causation or correlation were necessary. The
simple rate of ignorance was newsworthy by itself. The students did test
some hypotheses about the causes of ignorance by comparing chain stores
with independent pharmacies and older pharmacists with younger ones. No
meaningful differences were found, nor were they necessary for newsworthiness.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
second boost to generalizability comes from the fact that all of the pharmacies
in the defined area were tested. Sampling was involved within the pharmacies
because the person on duty when the student condom buyer appeared represented
all of the pharmacists who worked there. Overall, those pharmacists could
be taken as representative of those on duty during hours convenient for
student shoppers.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The

directly to the AIDS education of the newspaper's readers.</font></font></span>

<p><b><font face="arial, palatino"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>The
underage drinking crackdown</font></font></font></b>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>A
more complicated research design was executed by an earlier class in 1982.
The purpose of this one was to test the effectiveness of a Chapel Hill
police crackdown on illegal beer purchases by persons under 18. This time,
a causal inference was sought. The hypothesis: when the police crack down,
beer sales dry up. To test it, beer sellers in neighboring jurisdictions
were used as a control. A secondary hypothesis was also tested: police
are more likely to watch on weekend nights, and so violations will be more
frequent on week nights.&nbsp;</font></font></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In
Chapel Hill, there was no sampling. Every convenience store and tavern
was visited. Controls were drawn from the yellow pages section of the phone
book and accumulated in order of their proximity to Chapel Hill until a
matching number was reached. The buyers were all 18 years old, so that
no laws would be broken. The variable being measured was whether the sellers
of beer would verify the age of these young people by asking for identification.
Verification is sufficiently salient to teenagers that they have a slang
term for it: "carding."&nbsp;</font></font></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>A
total of 246 attempts to buy beer was made. The overall rate of carding
in Chapel Hill on a Saturday night was 22 percent, a number which, standing
alone, suggests that the police crackdown was not very effective. However,
the carding rate outside Chapel Hill was only 6 percent, revealing a significant
effect after all.&nbsp;</font></font></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
rate of carding in Chapel Hill dropped on Monday night to 7 percent, and
was no longer significantly different from the rate outside Chapel Hill.
Bottom line: the police crackdown did have a selective effect on weekends,
none at all on other times, and there were still plenty of opportunities
for illegal drinking by minors.&nbsp;</font></font></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Executing
such a field experiment is not as simple as it sounds. The field workers
have to be trained so that they&nbsp;<a NAME="171"></a>follow uniform behaviors
that will generate quantifiable data. We had each 18-year-old accompanied
by an upperclassman or graduate student who observed and recorded the outcome
of each test. We also had a rule against drinking on the job by our field
force. That led to some awkward social situations. "We were the only customers
in the bar," one of the supervisors reported. "The waitress was very nice
and served Wendy a beer and then sat across the bar to talk to us. Wendy
would casually pick up her glass and then set it down again without taking
a sip. I avoided looking the waitress in the eye by staring out the glass
door to the parking lot." The students left abruptly, pretending to pursue
a friend spotted in a passing car.<a NAME="7return3" href="Chapter7.htm#7-3"></a><a NAME="7return3" href="Chapter7.htm#7-3"></a><sup><a href="Chapter7.htm#7-3" name="7return3">3</a></sup></font></font></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Some
journalists are uncomfortable with the ethical considerations in such deception.
Participant observation is, however, a time-honored tradition in both journalism
and social science. And, at least where monitoring of public service is
concerned, even so stringent an ethicist as Sissela Bok gives qualified
approval where the monitoring leads to higher standards of public protection.<a NAME="7return4" href="Chapter7.htm#7-4"></a><a NAME="7return4" href="Chapter7.htm#7-4"></a><sup><a href="Chapter7.htm#7-4" name="7return4">4</a></sup></font></font></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Field
experiments are satisfying in their directness. Instead of asking about
social behavior in a survey, you get a chance to observe it straightforwardly.
When the hypothesis is clearly formulated in advance, you can design the
experiment to test the hypothesis in the most efficient way and use randomization
or test a total population so that error variance is minimized.</font></font></span>

for experimentation</font></font></font></b>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
rules for experimental research have been well codified over the years,
starting with John Stuart Mill's nineteenth-century proposals for scientific
method.<a NAME="7return5" href="Chapter7.htm#7-5"></a><a NAME="7return5" href="Chapter7.htm#7-5"></a><sup><a href="Chapter7.htm#7-5" name="7return5">5</a></sup>
However, some of the essential principles are intuitively apparent. Thomas
D. Cook and Donald T. Campbell cite the story of a seventeenth-century
experiment by a group of Frenchmen to test Pascal's theory of atmospheric
pressure. They were looking for the cause of the Torricellian vacuum. A
tube is filled with mercury and turned upside down with its lower end in
a dish of mercury. The column of mercury falls until it is about&nbsp;<a NAME="172"></a>30
inches high, and a vacuum remains in the space above it. What supports
the column? Pascal thought it was the weight of the air pressing on the
mercury in the dish. On a fall day in 1648, seven Frenchmen took two tubes,
two dishes, and lots of mercury to a mountain. At the bottom of the mountain
they set up the two tubes and found the column of mercury was about 28
inches tall. Then, leaving one tube with an observer, they carried the
other one 3,000 feet up the mountain and took another measurement. This
time the mercury was less than 24 inches tall. They then varied the conditions
on the mountaintop, taking measurements at different places and inside
a shelter. All yielded the same number. On the way down, they stopped at
an intermediate height and got an intermediate reading. At the bottom their
observer there verified that the mercury in his tube had not changed. Then
they set up the tube from the mountaintop one more time and saw that it
now gave the same reading as the one that had been there at the bottom
all the time.</font></font></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Pascal's
theory was supported. The second column of mercury had served as a control,
showing that the different readings on the mountain were due to the elevation,
not to something that had happened generally in the atmosphere during their
climb. By taking measurements in all the different conditions they could
think of, the experimenters were checking for rival hypotheses. And by
taking a measurement halfway down, they were showing a continuous effect.
Their example, say Cook and Campbell, "is redolent with features of modern
science."<a NAME="7return6" href="Chapter7.htm#7-6"></a><a NAME="7return6" href="Chapter7.htm#7-6"></a><sup><a href="Chapter7.htm#7-6" name="7return6">6</a></sup></font></font></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>For
the drinking-age experiment to have been as careful as the one performed
by those seventeenth-century researchers, we would have had to do it twice:
once before the police crackdown and once after. That would rule out the
possibility that there is some ongoing condition in Chapel Hill that explains
its higher Saturday-night carding rate. Experimental designs can take a
great variety of forms, and it helps to keep track of them if you make
diagrams. Here is one, adapted from Samuel Stouffer,<a NAME="7return7" href="Chapter7.htm#7-7"></a><a NAME="7return7" href="Chapter7.htm#7-7"></a><sup><a href="Chapter7.htm#7-7" name="7return7">7</a></sup>

of steel and fabric. We designed this simple test: Students in teams of
two got into automobiles and drove to randomly chosen traffic lights, looping
around until they were first in line at a red light. When the light turned
to green, the driver held the car's position and waited for the car behind
to honk. The passenger meanwhile used a stopwatch to clock the time from
the green light to the first honk from behind. Hypothesis: pre-honking
time in Chapel Hill would be significantly longer than pre-honking time
in other cities. When spring break came, the students scattered to their
various homes and vacation spots and repeated the experiment at random
intersections there. The outcome: Chapel Hill's reputation was justified.
Its mean pre-honking time, more than eight seconds, was more than double
that for other cities. In fact, some Chapel Hill motorists never honked
at</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">all, but waited
patiently through another traffic light cycle.</font></font></span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Another
famous experiment where the manipulation was introduced involved a militant
civil rights group in southern California in the 1960s. A professor at
California State College at Los Angeles recruited five blacks, five whites,
and five&nbsp;<a NAME="175"></a>Mexican-Americans to attach "Black Panther"
bumper stickers to their cars. All drove routinely to and from campus along
Los Angeles freeway routes. All had perfect driving records for the previous
twelve months. All signed statements promising not to drive in unfamiliar
parts of the city or in a manner to attract police attention.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
experiment was halted after seventeen days. The $500 set aside to pay traffic
fines had been used up. The first arrest, for an incorrect lane change,
was made two hours after the experiment began. One subject got three tickets
in three days and dropped out. In total, the fifteen previously perfect
drivers collected thirty-three citations for moving violations in the seventeen
days that they displayed the bumper stickers.<a NAME="7return8" href="Chapter7.htm#7-8"></a><a NAME="7return8" href="Chapter7.htm#7-8"></a><sup><a href="Chapter7.htm#7-8" name="7return8">8</a></sup></font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

journalism, the honking and bumper-sticker studies may have been sound
enough, but even journalists need to know about the hazards of such research.
When experiments are inadequately controlled, the expectations of both
the experimenter and the subjects can yield spurious effects. There is
some evidence that teacher expectancies have a lot to do with how a child
performs in school. Robert Rosenthal demonstrated the effect by giving
teachers lists of pupils whose psychological test results indicated superior
performance. The pupils did in fact perform better than their classmates,
even though Rosenthal had compiled his list by random selection. He called
it "Pygmalion effect."<a NAME="7return9" href="Chapter7.htm#7-9"></a><a NAME="7return9" href="Chapter7.htm#7-9"></a><sup><a href="Chapter7.htm#7-9" name="7return9">9</a></sup></font></font></span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;

better-known problem occurs when the subjects in an experiment realize
that something special is happening to them. Just the feeling of being

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>This
phenomenon is called Hawthorne effect after a series of experiments at
Western Electric Company's Hawthorne Plant in Chicago in 1927. Six women
were taken from a large shop department that made telephone relays and
placed in a test room where their job conditions could be varied and their
output measured. Their task was fairly simple: assemble&nbsp;<a NAME="176"></a>a
coil, armature, contact springs, and insulators by fastening them to a
fixture with four screws. It was about a minute's worth of work. Each time
a worker completed one, she dropped it into a chute where an electric tape-punching
device added it to the total for computing the hourly production rate.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>To
establish the base for a pretest-posttest design, the normal production
rate was measured without the assemblers being aware of the measurement.
Then the experiment was explained to them: how it was to test the effect
of different working conditions such as rest periods, lunch hours, or working
hours. They were cautioned not to make any special efforts but to work
only at a comfortable pace.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

happened next has achieved the status of myth in the separate literature
of both social science and business administration. In the former, it is
regarded as a horror story. For the latter, it is considered inspirational.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
second variable in the experiment (Time 2) was the production rate for
five weeks in the test room while the subjects got used to the new surroundings.
Time 3 changed the piece rate rules slightly. Times 4, 5, and 6 changed
the rest periods around. And so it went for eleven separate observations.
And for each observation, production went up -- not up and down as the
conditions were varied. Just up.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Nonplussed,
the experimenters threw the test into reverse. They took away all the special
work breaks, piece rates, and rest periods. Production still went up. They
put back some of the special conditions. More improvement. No matter what
they did, production got better.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Something
was going on. It was "testing effect." The six women knew they were in
an experiment, felt good about it, enjoyed the special attention, and were
anxious to please. They formed a separate social set within the plant,
had frequent contact with management, and took part in the decisions over
how the experimental conditions were to be manipulated. Their participation
and the sense of being special overrode the effect of the initial admonition
to make no special effort and work only at a comfortable pace. The study
never found out what combination of rest periods, lunch&nbsp;<a NAME="177"></a>hours,
or payment methods has the most effect on productivity. But it was not
wasted. The company learned that production improves when management shows
concern for workers , and management and workers are "organized in cooperation
with management in the pursuit of a common purpose."<a NAME="7return10" href="Chapter7.htm#7-10"></a><a NAME="7return10" href="Chapter7.htm#7-10"></a><sup><a href="Chapter7.htm#7-10" name="7return10">10</a></sup>

the notation system of Samuel Stouffer, we see many observations at different
points in time. An experimental manipulation is inserted between each of
the adjoining pairs of observations. A better design would have had a row
of Y's parallel to the X's to represent a control group with a similar
special room and the same amount of special attention but no changes in
working conditions. Better yet, get a different group (randomly selected,
of course) for each experimental condition. Make repeated measurements
and insert the change somewhere in the middle, say between the third and
fourth observations. In that way you can verify that the control group
and the experimental group are not alike to start with but are responding
in the same way to the passage of time and to the effects of being measured.</font></font>

that correlate with time is with imagination. Stouffer noted that the basic

at once and not compared to anything, we "do not know much of anything,"
he said. "But we can still fill pages ... with 'brilliant analysis' if
we use plausible conjecture in supplying missing cells from our imagination.
Thus we may find that the adolescent today has wild ideas and conclude

on control groups can be a good idea in survey research when you return
to the same respondents to get a pretest, posttest measure. The <i>Miami
Herald</i> did that when Martin Luther King was assassinated just after
it had completed a survey of its black population. The hypothesis was that
King's nonviolent ideology was weakened by his death and the advocates
of violence had gained. Fortunately, the earlier survey had asked questions
about both kinds of behavior, and records of who had been interviewed had
been retained. At the suggestion of Thomas Pettigrew, the <i>Herald</i>
added a control group of fresh respondents to the second wave of interviews.
The original respondents had had time to think about their responses, might
have been changed by the interview experience, might even have read about
themselves in the <i>Miami Herald</i>. Any differences at Time 2 might
simply be the effect of the research process rather than any external event.

<i>Statistical
regression</i>. Journalists have been easy prey to this one. A school board
announces a program to focus on its worst-performing schools and improve
them. It picks the two or three schools with the worst test scores in the
previous year and lavishes attention and new teaching methods on them.
Sure enough, the next year those schools have better test scores. The problem

toward the mean</i>, because it always moves the extreme&nbsp;<a NAME="181"></a>performers,
top and bottom, closer to the mean on the second test. It is a danger any
time that you select the extremes of a distribution for treatment. Most
educators know about it, but knowing about it doesn't stop them from taking
the credit for it.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>5.
<i>Selection</i>.
If comparison groups are not chosen strictly at random, then hidden biases
can destroy their comparability. Self-selection is the worst kind. If you
were doing the Black Panther experiment, and you let students volunteer
to display the bumper stickers, you might get the risk takers and therefore
the most reckless drivers.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>6.
<i>Mortality</i>.
Not all of the subjects remain available during an experiment that lasts
over a period of time. Those who drop out or get lost may be different
in some systematic way. In the evaluation of Head Start programs for preschool
children, for example, the children with the most-motivated parents were
more likely to finish the treatment. The selective dropping out of the
less motivated took away children who had poorer family situations and
maybe other strikes against them. Their absence for the final comparisons
made Head Start look better than it really is.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>7.
<i>Instrumentation</i>.
The measuring scale may have more flexibility in the middle than at the
extremes. Audiences rating different moments of a presidential debate on
a seven-point scale can make wider swings from the midpoint than when the
comparison is made from an extremely high or low point.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>8.
<i>The
John Henry effect</i>. Members of a control group might know they are in
a control group and try harder just out of rivalry. Students in some educational
experiments have been suspected of doing this. John Henry, you may remember,
was the steel-driving man who "wouldn't let a steam drill beat him down"
in the traditional folk ballad.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>9.
<i>Resentful
demoralization</i>. Just the reverse of the John Henry effect. Control
groups see the experimental group as being more favored, and they stop
trying.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>See
Cook and Campbell<a NAME="7return13" href="Chapter7.htm#7-13"></a><a NAME="7return13" href="Chapter7.htm#7-13"></a><sup><a href="Chapter7.htm#7-13" name="7return13">13</a></sup>
for the full list of threats to experimental validity. But don't be discouraged
by them. As Campbell noted many years ago, "all measures are complex&nbsp;<a NAME="182"></a>and
all include irrelevant components that may produce apparent effects."<a NAME="7return14" href="Chapter7.htm#7-14"></a><a NAME="7return14" href="Chapter7.htm#7-14"></a><sup><a href="Chapter7.htm#7-14" name="7return14">14</a></sup>
It is not necessary to become so frightened of those irrelevant components
that one avoids field experiments. It is only necessary to be aware of
the things that can go wrong and treat your own work with the appropriate
skepticism.&nbsp;</font></font>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><b><font face="arial, helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Oddball
measures</font></font></font></b>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>One
way to foil many of Campbell's demons is to look for <i>nonreactive measures</i>
of newsworthy phenomena. Such measures sometimes occur in nature. For example,
you can estimate the age of viewers of a museum exhibit by locating the
nose prints on the glass case and measuring their height from the floor.
This example and many others comes from a wonderful book by Eugene J. Webb,
Donald Campbell, and others which was written under the working title,
"Oddball Measures." (" . . . it is only a fear of librarians that has caused
us to drop it," the authors reported.)<a NAME="7return15" href="Chapter7.htm#7-15"></a><a NAME="7return15" href="Chapter7.htm#7-15"></a><sup><a href="Chapter7.htm#7-15" name="7return15">15</a></sup>
Their nonreactive measures include the simple observation of behavior where
the observer does not intrude on the scene. For example, one study that
they cite examined the social distance of whites and blacks in a college
setting by observing the degree of racial clustering when whites and blacks
chose their seats in classrooms. The effects of ghost stories told to a
seated circle of children was observed by noting the shrinking diameter
of the circle.</font></font></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Content
analysis is a nonreactive measure. You can trace the diffusion of the switch
from using the term "Negro" to "black" by counting both words and establishing
their ratio in different newspapers and at different times. Archival records
normally are not changed by the act of measuring. With modern computer
archives, however, one cannot be so certain. Publication of a paper evaluating
a newspaper's editorial skill by measuring the rate of certain misspelled
words might conceivably induce the paper's editors to correct the misspellings
in the electronic database. Records kept over time are subject to changes
in the efficiency of record keeping. Thus archival data can show an increase
in criminal&nbsp;<a NAME="183"></a>activity after a period of police reform
if one of the reforms is better record keeping.</font></font></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Webb
and colleagues also cite the case of a Chicago automobile dealer who had
his mechanics check the radio of every car brought in for service to see
what station it was tuned to. The dealership then placed its advertising
with the most popular stations. And then there is the classic story of
the measurement of attention to a football game by monitoring pressure
gauges at the city water department. The greater the audience, the greater
the pressure drop during commercials as toilets are flushed across the
viewing area.</font></font></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Government
agencies often use evaluation research to test the effectiveness of their
programs. Knowing about Campbell's demons can help you evaluate the evaluators.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>A
classic example is the great Connecticut crackdown on drunken drivers when
Abraham Ribicoff was governor in 1955. He imposed a program of intensified
law enforcement, and the annual rate of traffic deaths dropped by 12.3
percent in 1956. If you just look at the two years, you have a simple pretest,
posttest design, and the governor's program seems to have worked. But if
you check out the longer time series, you see that there was wide year-to-year
variation, and 1955 happened to be a peak year. Reforms are often instituted
when a problem is at its peak. Since chance alone may account for the peak,
a measurement in the following year, thanks to statistical regression,
will likely be closer to the long-run average. That may be all that happened
in Connecticut.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
effect of reforms is easiest to measure if they are introduced abruptly.
You then can look for their effect against the background of a longer time
trend.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In
educational reforms, look for Hawthorne effect and selective retention
as factors that will make just about any school administration look good.
Schools get a lot attention when they try a new technique, and their pretest,
posttest studies show that it works. Journalists give it big play. Then
you stop hearing about it, and after a few years the technique is forgotten.
That's because the Hawthorne effect wears off,&nbsp;<a NAME="184"></a>and
the new technique proves no better than the old in the long run. However,
nobody calls a press conference to tell you that.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Selective
retention (Campbell's "mortality") occurs when only the most motivated
students continue to show up for a special program. To prove that the program
works, administrators compare those who finished with those who dropped
out. Sure enough, they perform better. But chances are they would have
done so in the absence of the new program, because they were more energetic,
aggressive, and better motivated to start with. Indeed, even the beneficial
effect of a college education has been shown to disappear when family background
is held constant. Going to college identifies you as a person with above-average
earning power. It does not necessarily give you that power. Your genes,
and possibly your family connections, did that.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>One
of the frustrating aspects of evaluation research is that political realities
tend to work against sound research designs. A true experiment requires
randomization of the experimental treatment. That is the best way to assure
that the experimental and control groups are equal to start with. But if
there is some reason to believe that the experimental treatment really
does confer an advantage, then the most politically astute are more likely
to get it.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>An
experimental plan to eliminate poverty through the simple expedient of
giving poor people money was devised by the federal government in the administration
of Lyndon Johnson. It was to take place in New Jersey and use entire communities
as units of analysis. That way, there could be controls without people
living next door to each other in similar circumstances and getting different
treatment from the government. But nobody could figure out a way to decide
what communities would get the treatment and which ones would have to settle
for being controls.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
federal government's most ambitious attempt to distribute benefits and
costs equally through randomization was the draft lottery during the war
in Vietnam. In theory, the men in the armed forces should have been a representative
sample of the population. They weren't even close, because&nbsp;<a NAME="185"></a>the
more affluent men of draft age were more clever at figuring out ways to
beat the system by staying in school, joining the National Guard, feigning
illness, or leaving the country. Actually, more than cleverness was involved,
because staying in school cost money and getting into the Guard sometimes
took political connections.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 140%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Where
the government is not involved, randomization is easier. Clinical drug
trials use the double-blind method where treatment and control groups are
randomly assigned a test drug or a placebo, and neither the person getting
the drug nor the person administering it knows which is which. Even that
procedure sometimes is given a political justification: the new drug is
scarce, and random selection is a fair way to decide who should get it.
However, the tradition of using the marketplace to allocate scarce resources
is strong, and opportunities for true experiments in education and social
policy will probably always be rare. That makes the need for skeptical
journalistic attention to policy-related quasi experiments all the more
important.</font></font><o:p></o:p></span>
