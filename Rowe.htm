<blockquote><b>I AM GRATEFUL AND HONORED TO BE HERE AS THE PARK LECTURER.</b>
<p><b>I RETURN TO THE SOUTH, ALWAYS, TO REVEL IN MY SOUTHERNNESS AND ITS
IMPRINT ON EVERYTHING ABOUT ME.</b>
<p><b>WILLIE MORRIS, ANOTHER CHILD OF THE SOUTH, SPOKE MY HEART WHEN HE
WROTE "I GO BACK TO THE SOUTH TO REMIND MYSELF WHO I AM, FOR THE SOUTH
KEEPS ME GOING, IT IS A FEELING IN THE BLOOD WHICH PERVADES MY AWARENESS
OF MY COUNTRY AND MY CIVILIZATION."</b>
<p><b>THIS IS MY 30TH YEAR WORKING IN DAILY NEWSPAPERS. MY FIRST FULL-TIME
NEWSPAPER JOB WAS AS AN EDITORIAL ASSISTANT TYPING THE TV LISTINGS. NINE
YEARS LATER, AT AGE 31, I WAS NAMED MANAGING EDITOR OF THE THEN LEDGER-STAR,
A 100,000 CIRCULATION NEWSPAPER IN NORFOLK, VA.</b>
<p><b>MY PUBLISHER AT THE TIME, PERRY MORGAN, WAS A SOUTHERN JOURNALIST
WHO COULD GIVE WORDS WINGS AND WAS ALSO A CONSUMMATE U.N.C. FAN. LIKE ALL
GOOD CHAPEL HILL LOYALISTS HE LOOKED DOWN ON MY ALMA MATER, EAST CAROLINA,
AS ACADEMICALLY CHALLENGED AND CULTURALLY BEREFT.</b>
<p><b>THE DAY OF MY PROMOTION HE CONGRATULATED ME BY SAYING DAMNED IF HE
EVER THOUGHT HE WOULD LIVE TO SEE THE DAY HIS NEWSPAPER WAS EDITED BY AN
E.C.T.C. GRADUATE. THE MEMORY OF THAT PUTDOWN CERTAINLY KEPT ME HUMBLE
IN WHAT I THOUGHT WAS MY HOUR OF SHINING GLORY AND HAS HELPED ME KEEP GROUNDED
IN THE CAROLINA CLAY IN THE YEARS SINCE.</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><b>I THINK PERRY -- MY MENTOR, CONSTANT CHEERLEADER AND LOVING
FRIEND -- LATER THOUGHT I ROSE TO THE CHALLENGE. AS IS THE CASE WITH MOST
PEOPLE WHEN CHALLENGED BY CIRCUMSTANCES OR FATE.</b>
<p><b>RISING TO THE CHALLENGE. THOSE ARE WORDS WE'VE HEARD AND THOUGHT
ABOUT A LOT IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS. FOLKS SAY THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT
HAS DONE. INDEED, THE WHOLE U.S. GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO HAVE ITS ACT TOGETHER
MORE THAN PERHAPS ANY OF US BELIEVED IT COULD MUSTER IN SUCH A SHORT TIME.</b>
<p><b>AND WHAT OF THE PRESS? WE HAVE BEEN PRONOUNCED AS 'RISING TO THE
CHALLENGE.' WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE PRESS IN GENERAL AND NEWSPAPERS
IN PARTICULAR?</b>
<p><b>I BELIEVE THE JOURNALISTIC LANDSCAPE IS CHANGED, AND WE ARE THE BETTER
FOR IT. WE HAVE TURNED FROM TITILLATION AND THE TRIVIAL TOWARD MATTERS
OF CONSEQUENCE AND SUBSTANCE. NEWS THAT CAPTURED HEADLINES AND THE PUBLIC'S
ATTENTION IN AUGUST IS NOT EVEN A BLIP IN THE PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS TODAY.</b>
<p><b>WHAT OF GARY CONDIT'S SEX LIFE? BILL CLINTON'S SEX LIFE? HOW ABOUT
THE LENGTH OF PRESIDENT BUSH'S TEXAS SUMMER VACATION? REMEMBER THE SPARRING
OVER THE LOCKBOX? OR AL GORE'S BEARD? OH, HOW IRRELEVANT, EVEN ABSURD,
IT ALL SEEMS NOW.</b>
<p><b>NEWSPAPERS ARE ON OUR GOOD DAYS MIRRORS REFLECTING BACK TO THE PUBLIC
AN ACCURATE, AUTHENTIC PICTURE OF LIFE IN OUR TIMES AND INFORMING THEM
ON MATTERS OF CONSEQUENCE.</b>
<p><b>IN THIS TRAGEDY, WE HAVE REDISCOVERED OUR SERIOUS PURPOSE, WHAT HISTORIAN
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN CALLS 'OUR LARGER PUBLIC SELVES.' IN THIS DEEPLY TROUBLING
TIME THE PRESS HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECAPTURE RESPECT AND RECONNECT WITH
OUR READERS.</b>
<p><b>WE HAD BETTER SEIZE THIS HISTORIC MOMENT. IT MAY NOT COME OUR WAY
AGAIN.</b>
<p><b>THE LANDSCAPE HAS CHANGED IN WAYS WE NEVER COULD HAVE IMAGINED IN
THE LAZY DAYS OF LATE SUMMER.</b>
<p><b>WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT GETTING THE MAIL EVERY DAY WOULD CAUSE
DEEPLY ANXIOUS MOMENTS FOR SO MANY, THAT IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OFFICES
AND HOMES, ORDINARY FOLKS WOULD WEAR RUBBER GLOVES AND MASKS TO OPEN MAIL
DELIVERED BY OUR OWN U.S. POSTAL SERVICE?</b>
<p><b>WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT ALL AIRPORTS IN THE COUNTRY WOULD BE
SHUTTERED AND RETAIL ACTIVITY WOULD GRIND TO A COMPLETE HALT FOR THE BETTER
PART OF A WEEK?</b>
<p><b>WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT A RECORDING OF THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER WOULD
ONE WEEK IN OCTOBER BE THE TOP SELLING CD IN AMERICA, AND THAT THOUSANDS
OF STORES AROUND THE COUNTRY WOULD SELL OUT OF AMERICAN FLAGS?</b>
<p><b>NONE OF US COULD HAVE FORESEEN OUR NEW REALITY, OUR 'NEW NORMAL'
AS OUR LEADERS CALL IT.</b>
<p><b>SO, TOO, THE PRESS HAS A NEW REALITY. WHAT WAS CONVENTIONAL WISDOM
JUST TWO MONTHS AGO IS NO LONGER EASILY ACCEPTED. THE OLD CONVENTIONAL
WISDOM IS GIVING WAY TO THE NEW. AND NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON.</b>
<p><b><u>1. OLD CONVENTIONAL WISDOM: CYNICISM COMES WITH THE JOURNALISTIC
TERRITORY.</u></b>
<p><b><u>NEW CONVENTIONAL WISDOM: CYNICISM IS DEAD.</u></b>
<p><b>DECLARING THE AGE OF CYNICISM OVER IS FAIRLY TYPICAL OF THE GRANDIOSE
STATEMENTS AND SWEEPING GENERALITIES THE CHATTERING CLASS FLOATED IN THE
FIRST FEW DAYS AFTER THE ATTACK. DREAM ON. BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT JOURNALISTIC
CYNICISM HAS BEEN TAMED AND TEMPERED BY THE ACTS OF SAVAGE ZEALOTRY WE
WITNESSED SEPT.11. IT'S A GOOD THING. WE HAD RAISED CYNICISM TO AN ART
FORM, TO THE DETRIMENT OF OUR CREDIBILITY.</b>
<p><b>NOW IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE MOST EVIL, MURDEROUS ACTS IMAGINABLE
THE WORLD LOOKS AS DIFFERENT TO JOURNALISTS AS IT DOES TO REAL PEOPLE.
MORE FRIGHTENING, CERTAINLY, BUT PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY WE ARE AWARE
OF THE FUNDAMENTAL GOODNESS, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR SELFLESS ACTS OF HEROISM
FROM ORDINARY CITIZENS AND HIGH OFFICIALS ALIKE. JOURNALISTS, TOO, ARE
DEEPLY AFFECTED BY THAT.</b>
<p><b>CYNICISM, LONG EXCUSED AS SKEPTICISM ON STEROIDS, AS INTELLECTUAL
TOUGHNESS, HAS NEVER BEEN A LEGITIMATE JOURNALISTIC TOOL. IT HAS GIVEN
RISE TO OUR OWN WORST ELITIST TENDENCIES. CYNICISM IS AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN
THE ENEMY OF BOTH RIGOR AND FAIRNESS, WHICH ARE THE TOUCHSTONES OF EXCELLENCE.</b>
<p><b>CYNICISM HAS CAUSED THE PRESS TO FAIL TO SEE CLEARLY THAT FOLKS MOSTLY
STRIVE TO DO RIGHT, THAT PUBLIC OFFICIALS ARE NOT FUNDAMENTALLY CORRUPT.
CYNICISM HAS ENCOURAGED US TO ASSUME MOTIVE WHERE NONE CAN BE PROVED; TO
SEE INEPTNESS AS MALFEASANCE. CYNICISM HAS KEPT US FROM ACTING ON OUR OBLIGATION
TO CELEBRATE STRUGGLE AND SUCCESS AND HUMANITY AS VIGROUSLY AS WE POINT
OUT FLAWS -- AND THERE IS PLENTY OF HUMANITY TO CELEBRATE, IT TURNS OUT.</b>
<p><b>WHAT A DIFFERENCE ONE TRAGIC DAY MAKES.</b>
<p><b>BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11 POLICE IN NEW YORK CITY WERE THOUGHT OF BY MANY
AS RACIST THUGS WITH BADGES; THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK AS A HARD-HEARTED BULLY
WITH A PENCHANT FOR SAYING THE WRONG THING AT THE WRONG TIME, A MAYOR DAVID
LETTERMAN ONCE VILIFIED AND NOW CALLS THE PERSONIFICATION OF COURAGE. WE
ARE AS ONE WITH LETTERMAN. THE GOATS ARE NOW THE HEROES. COULD THEY HAVE
CHANGED THAT MUCH THAT FAST? OF COURSE NOT. IT IS, IN PART, THE PRISM THROUGH
WHICH WE VIEW THEM THAT HAS CHANGED.</b>
<p><b>CYNICISM, IT TURNS OUT, CANNOT SURVIVE THE WARM EMBRACE OF KINSHIP
AND SHARED EMOTIONS. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT; JOURNALISTS HAVE FELT
– AND SHOWN – THE SAME EMOTIONS AS OTHER CITIZENS DURING THE PAST 60 DAYS.
IMAGINE THAT. JUST LIKE 'REAL PEOPLE,' AS WE ARE FOND OF REFERRING TO THOSE
OUTSIDE OF NEWSROOMS.</b>
<p><b><u>2. OLD CONVENTIONAL WISDOM: THESE ARE THE WORST OF TIMES FOR THE
PRESS.</u></b>
<p><b><u>NEW CONVENTIONAL WISDOM: THE PRESS RULES.</u></b>
<p><b>AS WE CLOSED OUT THE 20TH CENTURY, MANY OF THE BEST MINDS IN JOURNALISM
SAW US AS A PROFESSION IN TROUBLE, AN INSTITUTION VITAL TO DEMOCRACY AND
COMMERCE AND COMMUNITY WITH A GROWING FAULT LINE BETWEEN ITS HIGHEST IDEALS,
ITS DAY-TO-DAY PRACTICES AND THE PUBLIC'S VIEW OF ITS PERFORMANCE.</b>
<p><b>BECAUSE OF CONSOLIDATION OF THE INDUSTRY, THE RELENTLESS PUSH FOR
EVER-INCREASING PROFITS FROM WALL STREET AND THE SUPREMACY OF ENTERTAINMENT
VALUES IN MEDIA, PEOPLE SAW BUSINESS IMPERATIVES IN CONFLICT WITH OUR PUBLIC
PURPOSE.</b>
<p><b>MOST DEEPLY TROUBLING WAS OUR OWN FRUSTRATION AND DISAPPOINTMENT
WITH THE PROFESSION. WHEN A PROFESSION IS ITSELF DISHEARTENED, UNSURE OF
ITS STANDARDS OR ITS WORTH, IT IS DANGEROUS GOING INDEED. SADDEST OF ALL
WASN'T THAT THE PUBLIC HAD LOW EXPECTATIONS OF US, WHICH WE STILL SOMETIMES
FAILED TO MEET, BUT THAT WE WERE NOT MEETING OUR OWN EXPECTATIONS.</b>
<p><b>WE HAVE HAD A ROUGH PATCH, NO DOUBT. I THINK THERE IS HOPE THAT THE
LOW OPINION OF US HAS BOTTOMED OUT. BECAUSE OF THE TRAGIC EVENTS OF SEPT
11, WE HAVE A CHANCE TO FIND OUR WAY, CLIMB OUT OF THE MUCK, TURN AWAY
FROM THE CELEBRATION AND ELEVATION OF THE INCONSEQUENTIAL, REDIRECT OUR
GAZE AWAY FROM CELEBRITY CHITCHAT AND THE SCANDAL DU JOUR TO WHAT REALLY
MATTERS.</b>
<p><b>IT IS ONLY BY DOING SO THAT WE CAN HONOR OUR HOPES AND FADED IDEALS
AND FULFILL OUR LARGER PUBLIC PURPOSE.</b>
<p><b>THE HIGH ROAD IS THERE IF WE WILL JUST TAKE IT. IF NEWSPAPER JOURNALISM
AND JOURNALISTS LONG FOR GREATER RESPECT, THEN NEWSPAPER EDITORS HAVE ONLY
TO PLAY DOWN – NOT PLAY UP – THE TRIVIAL, THE PERVERSE, THE BIZARRE.</b>
<p><b>THE TRAGIC EVENTS OF SEPT. 11 HAVE GIVEN US A CHANCE TO RECLAIM AND
REASSERT THE BEST THAT JOURNALISM HAS TO OFFER A WARY PUBLIC.</b>
<p><b><u>3. OLD CONVENTIONAL WISDOM: OBJECTIVITY REQUIRES A BLOODLESS DETACHMENT
FROM NEWS AND PEOPLE AT THE CORE OF IT.</u></b></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><b><u>NEW CONVENTIONAL WISDOM: IT'S A SMALL WORLD AND WE'RE
ALL IN IT TOGETHER.</u></b>
<p><b>HOW SAD THAT WE HAVE SUCCEEDED SO WELL IN SETTING OURSELVES APART
FROM THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. WE DID THIS BY APPROACHING ALMOST ALL STORIES
– EVEN STORIES OVERFLOWING WITH PATHOS AND HEARTBREAK -- FROM THE OUTSIDE.</b>
<p><b>WE HAD RAMPED UP PROFESSIONAL DETACHMENT TO THE POINT OF CALLOUSNESS
AND MISTAKEN BAD MANNERS FOR LEGITIMATE INQUIRY.</b>
<p><b>WE WORE OUR DETACHMENT AS A BADGE. WE ACTED AS IF WE COULD MAINTAIN
PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS ONLY BY BEING DETACHED – SEPARATE FROM OTHER PEOPLE
AND THEIR CONCERNS. WE WERE WRONG. BEING MEMBERS OF AN ELITIST CLASS COST
US DEARLY IN TRUST AND CREDIBILITY.</b>
<p><b>POST SEPT. 11 AN UNNATURAL DETACHMENT FROM EVENTS IS MORE JARRING
TO NORMAL FOLKS THAN EVER. TAKE THE CASE OF DAVID WESTIN, ABC NEWS PRESIDENT.
LAST WEEK WESTIN WAS SKEWERED BY MATT DRUDGE, OF ALL PEOPLE, FOR SAYING
HE HAD NO OPINION WHEN ASKED AT A COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY FORUM WHETHER THE
PENTAGON WAS AN APPROPRIATE MILITARY TARGET. ACTUALLY HE DID WORSE THAN
JUST SAYING HE HAD NO OPINION. HE LECTURED THE AUDIENCE ON THE IMPORTANCE
TO A FREE PRESS OF HIM NOT HAVING AN OPINION.</b>
<p><b>C'MON. NO OPINION OF WHETHER THE PENTAGON WAS AN APPROPRIATE TARGET?
IS THE PUBLIC REALLY SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT AND BUY IT? AND, EVEN IF
THEY DID, DOESN'T THAT MAKE THE PRESS SO DETACHED AS TO BE WITHOUT NORMAL
MORALS OR EMOTIONS?</b>
<p><b>WE CAN, AND MOSTLY ARE DOING BETTER THAN THIS KNEE-JERK OLD CONVENTIONAL
WISDOM OF EXPRESSING DETACHMENT, WHICH IS AT ODDS WITH COMMON SENSE.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>4. OLD CONVENTIONAL WISDOM: PEOPLE STORIES AREN'T REAL NEWS AND,
BESIDES, WE HAVE TOLD THEM ALL ALREADY.</u></b>
<p><b><u>NEW CONVENTIONAL WISDOM: NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF THE
PERSONAL STORY.</u></b>
<p><b>EVERY EDITOR IN AMERICA KNOWS THAT THE BEST EXECUTED STORIES OF HUMANITY
RECEIVE THE STRONGEST REACTION. YET I KNOW OF NO EDITOR WHO BELIEVES SHE
PAYS ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THAT IN HER NEWSROOM OR DOES THEM WELL ENOUGH.
THEY ARE KISSED OFF, DISMISSED AS NEWS LITE AND TOO OFTEN GHETTOIZED IN
FEATURE SECTIONS. WORSE, THE SAME RIGOR THAT IS BROUGHT TO THE MOST AMBITIOUS
WORK IS NOT OFTEN APPLIED TO THESE STORIES OF HUMANITY.</b>
<p><b>WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY UNDERESTIMATED READERS' LONGING FOR THE REAL
AND THE HUMAN.</b>
<p><b>LAST YEAR THE OREGONIAN WON THE PULITZER PRIZE FOR FEATURE WRITING
WITH A FOUR-PART SERIES ON A 14-YEAR-OLD BOY WITH A SEVERE FACIAL DEFORMITY
WHO RISKED LIFE-THREATENING SURGERY TO APPEAR MORE NORMAL. THE STORY REMINDED
US THAT WE ALL NEED TO BE ACCEPTED AND PAINTED A POWERFUL PORTRAIT OF WHAT
WE WILL DO TO GAIN THAT ACCEPTANCE. MORE THAN 3,500 READERS WROTE OR CALLED
THE NEWSPAPER TO THANK US FOR THE STORY. MORE THAN A YEAR LATER READERS
STILL STOP THE REPORTER ON THE STREET TO ASK HOW SAM, THE BOY, IS DOING.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>SIMILARLY, THE NYT'S MINI PROFILES OF THE VICTIMS OF SEPT. 11 HAVE
STRUCK A STRONGER CHORD WITH READERS THAN ANY OTHER COVERAGE THEY HAVE
DONE. THEY HAVE BEEN RUNNING A FULL PAGE – EACH ONE CONTAINING STORIES
OF ABOUT 15 VICTIMS – EVERY DAY. THESE STORIES – NO MORE THAN FOUR OR FIVE
PARAGRAPHS EACH, TELL YOU NOT THE FACTS – BUT THE LIVES OF THE INDIVIDUALS.
YOU START TO KNOW WHO DREAMED OF GOING BACK TO SCHOOL, WHO SPENT WEEKENDS
AT THEIR CHILDREN'S SOCCER GAMES, WHO HAD JUST CELEBRATED AN ANNIVERSARY
OR VOLUNTEERED IN SOUP KITCHENS OR SIMPLY EXCELLED IN BEING A FRIEND. REAL
LIFE, IN OTHER WORDS. IN ALL ITS GLORY.</b>
<p><b>READERS DEVOUR THEM. THIS PAGE IS THE ONE NEW YORK TIMES EDITORS
SAY THEY SEE PEOPLE READING ON SUBWAYS.</b>
<p><b>THE GREAT AND GLORIOUS NYT RESPECTED THESE 5,000 ORDINARY FOLKS ENOUGH
TO PRESENT AN HONEST SNAPSHOT OF THEIR LIVES. THAT'S A POWERFUL STATEMENT.
NO WONDER READERS RESPONDED. READ THESE NUGGETS AND WE SEE OURSELVES, WE
SEE OUR OWN DREAMS AND LIVES. THE TIMES HAS DECIDED TO KEEP PUBLISHING
THESE UNTIL THEY ARE DONE, 15 OR SO A DAY, A FULL PAGE, EVERY DAY FOR WHAT
WILL LIKELY BE ALMOST A YEAR.</b>
<p><b>MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. THESE SIMPLE STORIES ARE AS IMPORTANT TO
JOURNALISM AS THEY ARE TO LOVED ONES LEFT BEHIND. THE FACT THAT THE NYT,
THE GOLD STANDARD IN OUR BUSINESS, IS DEVOTING SEVERAL DOZEN REPORTERS
AND A FULL PAGE OF SPACE A DAY TO DO THIS, SPEAKS VOLUMES. IT HAS CHANGED
THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE NYT WITH SOME OF ITS READERS AND I PREDICT WILL
BE DISCUSSED IN JOURNALISM SCHOOLS LONG AFTER THE VICTIMS HAVE ALL BEEN
PROFILED.</b>
<p><b>WHY? BECAUSE WE ARE NOT USED TO THE NYT SHOWING SO MUCH HUMANITY.
AND BY DOING SO, AND DOING SO IN SUCH A VISIBLE, SUSTAINED WAY IT INFLUENCES
THE REST OF THE CRAFT.</b>
<p><b>REGARDING THAT, NO ONE UNDERSTOOD BETTER THE ROLE OF HUMANITY IN
DEMONSTRATING JOURNALISM'S RELEVANCE TO THE PUBLIC OR RAISED CRAFT TO A
HIGHER LEVEL THAN YOUR ALUMNUS, CHARLES KURALT.</b>
<p><b>KURALT WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY DID; HIS LOVE WAS
LANGUAGE AND HIS ART – STORYTELLING. HE CELEBRATED A WORLD OF JOY, LOSS,
TRIAL AND ACHIEVEMENT. HE TRAVELED THE COUNTRY HONORING LIVES OF ALL SORT.</b>
<p><b>IN A SPEECH ALMOST 20 YEARS AGO, KURALT PLEADED WITH US TO TURN AT
LEAST PART OF OUR ATTENTION AWAY FROM PURSUIT OF THE ENTERTAINER, THE POLITICIAN
AND THE CRIMINAL AND TOWARD "THE DECENT AND HONEST AND SOMETIMES NOBLE
LIVES OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS."</b>
<p><b>WE COULD DO WORSE.</b>
<p><b><u>5. OLD CONVENTIONAL WISDOM: WHAT IS RELEVANT IS CLOSE-TO-HOME
INFORMATION WE CAN ACT ON.</u></b>
<p><b><u>NEW CONVENTIONAL WISDOM: RELEVANCE IS RELATIVE – AND MAY BE FARTHER
AWAY THAN THE NEXT COUNTY.</u></b>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">IN A SEARCH FOR RELEVANCE AS THE KEY TO READERSHIP,
TOO MANY EDITORS ACTED AS IF RELEVANCE DEMANDED A MYOPIC FOCUS ON THE MUNDANE,
THE MINUTAE THAT OCCUPIES MUCH OF DAILY LIFE. SO, IF A NEWSPAPER GAVE YOU
INFORMATION YOU COULD APPLY DIRECTLY TO DECISIONS YOU MADE IN PREPARING
THAT NIGHT'S DINNER, PROVIDED YOU HELPFUL HINTS ON SHOPPING FOR PILLOWS,
OR TOLD YOU HOW TO LOSE 20 POUNDS BEFORE THE END OF THE WEEK, IT WAS SEEN
AS RELEVANT.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">BEFORE, NOT MANY OF US – EDITORS OR READERS –
SAW AS EQUALLY RELEVANT THE ARCANE ACTIVITIES OF A FANATICAL SECT BASED
IN AFGHANISTAN. NOT MANY EDITORS, THIS ONE INCLUDED, SAW OSAMA BIN LADEN
AS RELEVANT ENOUGH TO PUBLISH EVEN A FRACTION OF<b> </b>HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF WORDS WE HAVE PUBLISHED SINCE SEPT. 11.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">BUT IF SOMETHING HAPPENED WITHIN 20 MILES OF
THE NEWSPAPER OFFICE (THE CLOSER THE BETTER) WE SAW ITS RELEVANCE AS BEING
OFF THE CHARTS. AND AFGHANISTAN, MY LORD, THAT WAS SO FAR AWAY IT WAS OUR
METAPHOR FOR TOTAL IRRELEVANCE TO OUR READERS' LIVES.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">WE ALLOWED OUR FOCUS AND OUR STRENGTH -- OUR
LOCALNESS -- TO LIMIT OUR AMBITIONS. SUDDENLY WE HAVE FOUND WE CAN BE DEFINED
BY LOCAL WITHOUT BEING LIMITED BY IT. WHAT IS LOCAL IS NOT NECESSARILY
GEOGRAPHICALLY LIMITING ANY MORE THAN IT IS JOURNALISTICALLY LIMITING.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">RELEVANCE IS RELATIVE, AND IT IS ON TODAY'S RELEVANCE
THAT WE HAVE A CHANCE TO RECONSTRUCT OUR IMAGE AND REHABILITATE RELATIONS
WITH OUR READERS.</font>

ABOUNDS.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">WELL, WE'RE BACK IN THE WORLD. AND NOW WE'RE
SEEING THAT FOREIGN NEWS ISN'T JUST HEADLINES; IT'S REALLY A CULTURAL STORY.
PREVIOUSLY, WE'VE PRESENTED THE MID-EAST AS INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES LOCKED
IN A DEATH STRUGGLE, AS REQUIRING OCCASIONAL REPORTING ON A NEVER-ENDING
CONFLICT.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING AND WHAT WE ARE
NOW, BELATEDLY, ATTEMPTING IS TO COVER THE MIDEAST NOT JUST AS CONFLICT,
BUT AS CULTURE, AS A PLACE WITH A DIFFICULT HISTORY AND DIFFERENT VALUES.
IN OTHER WORDS, TO GIVE IT CONTEXT.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">WE COVERED CONFLICT, BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW TO COVER
CONFLICT. THAT IS HOW WE HAVE DEFINED NEWS. WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERING
BETTER ALL ALONG IS THE MORE COMPLEX CULTURAL STORY. THAT'S WHAT PROVIDES
INSIGHT AND UNDERSTANDING BEYOND THE BREAKING NEWS HEADLINES. THE COVERING

ORDER TO BE ABLE TO REPORT ON COMPLEX SUBJECTS WITH AUTHORITY, AUTHENTICITY
AND INSIGHT.</font>
<br>&nbsp;

<p><font face="HELVETICA">THE ROLE OF THE PRESS, SECOND ONLY TO THAT OF
THE ACADEMY, IS TO EDUCATE. BECAUSE WE HAVE UNDERESTIMATED THE NEED FOR
HISTORICAL, LITERARY, SOCIOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT AND FOR EXPLORING
STORIES OF GREAT COMPLEXITY, WE WERE OURSELVES ILL-PREPARED.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">THE PROBLEM HAS NEVER BEEN THAT WE DON'T HAVE

RIGHT QUESTIONS.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">BUT ONE THING JOURNALISTS DO WELL IS TO REACT
TO THE MOMENT AT HAND. AND REACT WE HAVE. VERY WELL, EXTRAORDINARILY WELL
FOR THE MOST PART. IN OUR NEWSPAPERS WE HAVE HAD DOZENS OF PAGES OF BACKGROUND
ON ISLAM AND THE TALIBAN AND GERM WARFARE AND ANTHRAX . WE HAVE PUBLISHED
GRAPHICS AND TIMELINES AND MAPS AND HAVE RESURRECTED THE TOO OFTEN IGNORED

GROSSLY UNDERESTIMATES PEOPLE'S INTELLIGENCE AND ATTENTION.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">IN THE DAYS SINCE SEPT. 11, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
HAVE BOUGHT NEWSPAPERS, DEVOURED THEM, PUT THEM AWAY IN FAMILY TRUNKS FOR
FUTURE GENERATIONS. THEY HAVE DONE THIS BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THE HISTORICAL
NATURE OF EVENTS. THEY ALSO HAVE DONE THIS BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE NEWSPAPERS
AS AUTHENTIC RECORDERS OF THAT HISTORY.</font>

THAT BACK THEN. BUT ON THE AFTERNOON OF NOV. 22, 1963, I WAS DRAFTED, ALONG
WITH EVERYONE ELSE IN THE LARGER NEWSPAPER FAMILY, TO HAWK EXTRAS. I WAS
SENT TO THE LOCAL COLLEGE CAMPUS, WHERE NORMALLY UNINTERESTED COLLEGE STUDENTS
NEARLY GRABBED THEM OUT OF OUR HANDS.</font>

<p><font face="HELVETICA">THESE ARE SUDDENLY SERIOUS TIMES, WITH THE NATURE
AND EXTENT OF OUR FREEDOM HANGING IN THE BALANCE. WE CAN ILL AFFORD A PRESS
THAT LIVES MOMENT TO MOMENT AND ILLUMINATES NOT AT ALL.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">WE WILL BE CHALLENGED IN KEEPING TO THE HIGH
ROAD BY OWNERS AND SHAREHOLDERS WHO PLACE MORE VALUE ON SHORT TERM RESULTS
THAN ON CREATION OF ENDURING VALUE. OUR SUCCESS ULTIMATELY MUST BE TIED
TO THE PUBLIC TRUST MORE THAN TO NEXT QUARTER'S PROFITS.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">AND MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT; IT IS EXPENSIVE
AND DIFFICULT. MANY DOUBT WHETHER MEDIA CONGLOMERATES, EVEN TODAY, WILL
MAKE THE INVESTMENT NECESSARY FOR TRUE PUBLIC SERVICE JOURNALISM. OUR SURVIVAL
MAY DEPEND ON IT. CERTAINLY OUR REPUTATION DOES.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="HELVETICA">WE WILL BE CHALLENGED IN KEEPING TO THE HIGH
ROAD BY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT WANT TO HEAR VOICES OF DISSENT.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">PEOPLE TODAY WANT OUR GOVERNMENT AND ITS LEADERS
TO SUCCEED. WE WANT THIS ON A GUT, EMOTIONAL LEVEL WHETHER OR NOT WE AGREE
WITH THEIR POLITICS. THEREFORE, VOICES OF DISSENT FEEL PARTICULARLY DISCORDANT.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">I LIVE ON<font color="#FF0000"> </font>WHAT WE
FONDLY (AND YOU DERISIVELY) CALL THE LEFT COAST, WHICH HAS A PROUD HISTORY
OF DISSENT. THE OREGONIAN'S READERS REMIND US EVERY DAY OF THE IMPORTANCE
OF DISSENT. WE HAVE BEEN AVERAGING MORE THAN 500 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
A WEEK SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, BY FAR THE VAST MAJORITY OPPOSING THE WAR OR
TAKING ISSUE WITH SOME ASPECT OF ITS CONDUCT.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">I REMEMBER THE EARLY DAYS OF PROTEST AGAINST
THE VIETNAM WAR. I WAS A STUDENT AT EAST CAROLINA, NOT EXACTLY A HOTBED
OF ANTI-WAR PROTESTS, SO AT FIRST WE TREATED PROTESTORS AS A BREED APART.
FRINGE THINKERS, TO BE SURE, COMMUNISTS MAYBE. WE WERE SURE THEY WERE WRONG.
BUT THINGS WERE NOT WHAT THEY SEEMED.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">THE SEEDS SOWN IN THOSE PROTESTS GREW INTO AN
ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT THAT DESTROYED LYNDON JOHNSON'S PRESIDENCY AND CONTRIBUTED
TO THE ENDING OF THE WAR. THEN, THIRTY YEARS LATER, ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL
ARCHITECTS OF THAT WAR, ROBERT MCNAMARA, APOLOGIZED FOR LYING TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE. THAT WAS POWERFUL CONFIRMATION THAT THINGS ARE NOT ALWAYS WHAT
THEY SEEM. LET THE VOICES OF DISSENT RING LOUD AS A BELL OF FREEDOM.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">WE WILL BE CHALLENGED IN KEEPING TO THE HIGH
ROAD BY A GOVERNMENT THAT IN TIMES OF THREAT HUNKERS DOWN AND KEEPS INFORMATION
HIDDEN EVEN MORE THAN NORMAL.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IT IS INAPPROPRIATE
FOR THE PRESS TO ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS WHEN WE ARE AT WAR.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">INDEED, EVEN THE PRESIDENT'S PRESS SECRETARY,
USING THE SYMPATHETIC PUBLIC AS HIS SHIELD, SAID, "THE PRESS IS ASKING
A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT I SUSPECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD PREFER NOT
BE ASKED. REPORT THE NEWS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,' ARI FLEISCHER SAID,
'BUT IF YOU REPORT IT IN ITS ENTIRETY THAT COULD RAISE CONCERNS.' TO WHICH
THE PRESIDENT OF SIGMA DELTA CHI SAID, "LET THE WHITE HOUSE RUN THE WAR
AND LET US REPORT THE NEWS." TO WHICH WE ALL SHOULD SAY, AMEN.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">NO ONE IN THE MEDIA OR AMONG CITIZEN-CONSUMERS
OF NEWS WANTS INFORMATION THAT COULD COMPROMISE NATIONAL SECURITY. BUT
INFORMATION FROM THE MILITARY IS ALWAYS FILTERED. GOVERNMENT HAS A NEED,
EVEN AN OBLIGATION, TO KEEP SOME THINGS SECRET. BUT THE PRESS HAS AN OBLIGATION
TO ASK QUESTIONS AND TO BE SKEPTICAL OF PAT ANSWERS, EVASIVENESS OR INCONSISTENCIES.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">WHEN INFORMATION IS MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN
AND VERIFY IS WHEN A VIGOROUS, RIGOROUS PRESS IS MOST NEEDED. INFORMATION
IS NOT DANGEROUS, PERILOUS TO OUR HEALTH.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">THE PENTAGON, WE HAVE LEARNED TO OUR NATION'S
GREAT SORROW, IS CAPABLE OF WILLFUL DECEPTION ABOUT ITS OWN POLICIES. BUT
THIS IS NOT VIETNAM; NOR IS IT THE GULF WAR, THE LET'S-HAVE-A-GLASS-OF-WINE-TURN-ON-THE-TV-AND-WATCH
KIND OF WAR. THIS WAR IS, EVEN IN ITS EARLIEST STAGES, A GROUND WAR WITH
A SHADOWY ENEMY IN A COUNTRY WITH ALMOST NO ACCESS FOR JOURNALISTS. WE
ARE MORE DEPENDENT ON THE QUALITY OF OUR QUESTIONS THAN ON OBSERVABLE EVENTS
AND VERIFIABLE FACTS. WE HAD BETTER ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">WE WILL BE CHALLENGED IN KEEPING TO THE HIGH
ROAD BY THOSE WHO ARE FEARFUL.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">WHEN TERRORISTS ATTACK OUR SYMBOLS OF TRADE,
OF PROSPERITY AND OF MILITARY MIGHT, WHEN THEY THREATEN OUR FREEDOM OF
MOVEMENT AND OUR COMMUNICATIONS, IT IS NATURAL THAT WE ARE AFRAID.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">BUT FACTS THEMSELVES DO NOT ADD FEAR; RATHER,
THEY STEADY THE NERVES OF SENSIBLE PEOPLE. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT LOOK
AT THE STEADYING EFFECT OF RUDY GIULIANI'S STRAIGHT-TALKING MANNER IN THE
CHAOTIC EARLY DAYS. INFORMATION, NO MATTER HOW UNSETTLING, IS NOT THE THREAT.
IT IS MORE NEARLY THE SAFEGUARD OF OUR FREEDOM.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">THE NEWS MEDIA CANNOT BE COWED BY THOSE WHO WILL
WISH TO TELL US ONLY WHAT THEY THINK IS GOOD FOR US. THE PRESS MUST NOT
SOFT-PEDAL THE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS. WE MUST NOT FORGET OUR DUTY TO SHINE
LIGHT IN DARK CORNERS. DEMOCRACY DEMANDS THAT WE SERVE THIS FUNCTION, IN
GOOD TIMES AND IN BAD.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="HELVETICA">THE HIGH ROAD IS, AS IT HAS BEEN, THERE FOR US.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">WE CAN PROVIDE TRUE PUBLIC SERVICE AS CITIZENS
STRUGGLE TO LEARN WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW TO GO ABOUT DAILY LIFE, WHAT THEY
NEED TO KNOW TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC SAFETY, WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW TO HELP
PRESERVE OUR FREEDOMS.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">THE COUNTRY'S STRENGTH, AND AS WE HAVE LEARNED,
ITS VULNERABILITY, COME FROM OUR BEST QUALITIES – OUR INCREDIBLE FREEDOM
OF MOVEMENT, OUR RELATIVELY OPEN BORDERS, OUR PLURALISM AND INCREASING
DIVERSITY.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">IF OUR OPENNESS AND OUR STRENGTH AS A FREE SOCIETY
MAKE US VULNERABLE AND ARE AT STAKE HERE, THEN THE PRESS COULD NOT POSSIBLY
HAVE A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE AT THIS MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY. AND IF PURPOSE
IS WHAT THE PRESS HAS NEEDED TO RE-ENGAGE WITH ITS OWN VALUES, THEN PURPOSE
WE HAVE AND RE-ENGAGE WE MUST.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">IT IS TODAY, AS IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN, A GREAT PRIVILEGE
TO BE A JOURNALIST. JOURNALISM MATTERS MORE THAN IT HAS IN DECADES. DESPITE
OUR SHORTCOMINGS WE HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE ABLE TO MEET THE CHALLENGE THAN
WE ARE TODAY.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">THE ATTACKERS, WE ARE TOLD, THOUGHT THEY WOULD
UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY. INSTEAD, WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHORE UP THE FOUNDATIONS
OF DEMOCRACY BY VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND HONORING
THE IDEALS ON WHICH IT STANDS.</font>
<p><font face="HELVETICA">IT IS A WORTHY GOAL. THANK YOU.</font></blockquote>
