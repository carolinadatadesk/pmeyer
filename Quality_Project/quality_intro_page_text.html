<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#333333">Good
journalism has always been the product of tension between profit making
and social responsibility. But there are recent signs that the struggle
is getting out of balance as publicly held companies defer to the short-term
demands of the investor community. One problem is that the costs of community-serving
journalism are easy to see while the benefits are not. The Quality Project
aims to correct this imbalance by finding ways to measure quality and track
its benefits to the bottom line.&nbsp; |</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#333333">Our
model is <a href="../marketplace_model.html" target="page">one
articulated by Hal Jurgensmeyer</a> (1931-1995), a Knight Ridder executive
in the 1970s who argued that a newspaper's main product is neither news
nor information but influence.&nbsp;</font></font>

Influence Model for the Newspaper Industry</font></font></font>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#333333">It creates
two kinds of influence, he said: societal influence, which is not for sale,
and commercial influence, which is for sale. But the two are closely related
because it is the societal influence that gives value to the commercial
influence. Published views of investment analysts suggest that they employ
a much simpler model: a newspaper is a platform for delivering advertising
to eyeballs. Their criterion for evaluating the platform is cost per eyeball.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#333333">With
resources assembled from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, New
Directions for News, and the Knight Chair in Journalism at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, we are seeking the widest possible collaboration
in developing empirical testing of the influence model. Progess on this
and related work was reported in April 2003 at the annual meeting of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors <a href="http://www.poynter.org/templates/column_a/default.asp?id=54&aid=29339">(ASNE)</a>.</font></font>
