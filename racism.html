<br><b><i><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size=+1>Synopsis</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">In 1993 the <i>New Orleans Times-Picayune</i>
published a trail-blazing series of articles on race relations that, among
other things, documented the <i>Times-Picayune</i>'s own racist past. No
other newspaper had ever taken such a searing look at its own role in perpetuating
segregation and white supremacy.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The project rocked New Orleans and sparked
controversy not only in the community, but within the paper's editorial
ranks. Work on the race relations series was emotionally wrenching for
both white and black staffers, and it resulted in heated arguments and
frayed or broken friendships. Some staffers described the many months they
spent on the project as traumatic and all-consuming. And although most
agreed they were proud of their role in the project, they were almost unanimous
in saying they would not want to go through it again.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The case raises a swath of profound issues
about the press. All journalists bring their own personal views and background
to the news, and journalists traditionally try to apply those personal
filters, not deny them, in pursuit of making the news more objective or
accurate. But as this case points out, what does this kind of diversity
in a newsroom mean? How can a paper institutionalize it? Students will
also examine whether certain subjects are so complex that they are beyond
the purview of journalists and must be left to historians? Ultimately,
students will be faced with the decision of how to measure success in journalism.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><i><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size=+1>Narrative</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">Staff members at the <i>New Orleans Times-Picayune</i>
had anguished over the idea of a race series for almost two years. It had
been stewing ever since their controversial coverage of a bruising racially
charged governor's race that pitted former Klansman David Duke against
former Governor Edwin Edwards. The editors and reporters had been so concerned
that Duke might defeat Edwards that they had taken the extraordinary step
of abandoning traditional journalistic neutrality and aggressively using
news columns as well as editorials in a concerted campaign to defeat Duke.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Edwards, boosted by the newspaper's campaign,
rolled on to a landslide victory. He defeated Duke 61 percent to 39 percent,
and polled more votes than any gubernatorial candidate in Louisiana history.
Later, analysts would say that without the newspaper's crusading explicitly
in its news columns, including investigating Duke at every opportunity,
the Klansman would have won.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Duke polled 680,070 votes, an impressive
total that reflected deep racial polarization in the state. That convinced
some black staffers, including city editor Keith Woods, that the newspaper
needed to address the problem in a major way.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Two days after the election, Woods took
the lead in proposing that the newspaper launch a project on race relations.
Woods felt that the <i>Times-Picayune</i> had not given adequate coverage
to racial problems and that an in-depth series on the subject might lead
to greater understanding of the problems and ultimately to better race
relations. The paper's 46-year-old editor, Jim Amoss, a Yale graduate and
Rhodes scholar, thought the idea had merit. Amoss, a native of New Orleans,
had closely monitored David Duke's career as a Klansman and thought the
proposal for a series on race was especially relevant in the aftermath
of Duke's strong showing in the gubernatorial election. But, at the time,
he and other white editors thought it would consume too much time and energy
when the paper could be focusing on projects that could bear fruit more
quickly.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Ashton Phelps Jr., the 47-year-old publisher,
proposed a series on crime. It, too, was a hot issue in New Orleans at
the time. Woods objected. He felt it would inevitably end up offending
blacks and become a case of white people examining black pathology. He
had no doubt that a series on crime invariably would carry the message
that it was a black problem, that blacks were inherently more disposed
to criminal activity, that they didn't seem capable of escaping the housing
projects and a criminal environment. It might, he also thought, preclude
a race relations series. Phelps' says that while he had suggested the newspaper
look at ways of helping reduce crime, which was rampant in New Orleans,
"the idea of a crime series never precluded or competed" with the race
relations series.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">In time, the suggestion of a crime series
faded and tackling race relations remained a topic of discussion, gaining
momentum the following year (1992) when racial rancor disrupted the traditionally
all-white New Orleans Mardi Gras parade. The predominantly African-American
city council passed an ordinance forcing Carnival Krewes&oacute;clubs that
run the parades and other social events&oacute;to integrate. For the city's
55-percent African-American population it was a measure long overdue. Some
wealthy white families who had opposed the ordinance decided, however,
to stop parading rather than integrate.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="arial,helvetica">Training for diversity</font></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica"><i>Times-Picayune</i> employees had recently
gone through diversity workshops dealing with both racial and gender feelings.
These also gave some traction to the idea for a project on race. The workshops
raised the racial consciousness not only of the rank and file, but of the
editor and publisher. Amoss said the workshops made him examine his own
feelings on race and made him much more sensitive to issues with racial
overtones. Phelps, who is especially sensitive about any criticism of the
paper's coverage of racial issues when his father was the publisher in
the 1960s and 1970s, said the experience made him examine his own "internal
feelings."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"One of the realizations I came to," he
said, "was that growing up in the 1950s and 60s in New Orleans, I never
heard a racially prejudiced remark from either of my parents."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">For weeks Woods continued to press the
idea of a race relations project on Amoss and two other white editors&oacute;Peter
Kovacs, the managing editor, and Kristin Gilger, assistant to the editor.
Gilger served in various editing positions at the <i>Times-Picayune</i>
from 1983 to 1994, when she became managing editor of the Salem, Oregon,
<i>Statesman-Journal</i>.
Since the series ran, she had become a senior editor of the <i>Arizona
Republic</i>'s metropolitan desk. All agreed a race series would make a
worthy project, but they seemed unable to agree on how to proceed.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Should it be a single series run on consecutive
days or a series that would run periodically? How many staffers should
be assigned and who among them would be best qualified to work on the project?
How much space would it require? And what specific topics should be covered?
Was the subject so sensitive that it might provoke a race riot? The editors
debated these questions and others repeatedly.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Not until March of 1992 did the four editors,
meeting over lunch, finally agree to assemble a biracial team to discuss
ways to carry out the project. After lunch, they sat in a car in the newspaper's
parking lot and selected reporters, a photographer, a copy editor, and
a graphic artist for the 18-member project staff.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Gilger was named project editor and, after
calling the first staff meeting in the newspaper's conference room, she
got an early taste of how difficult it would be to carry out the assignment.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"I started out," she said, "by saying we
would do a project on race and asked 'What do you want to do?' The meeting
quickly degenerated; there was so much hostility in the room. Black reporters
immediately challenged the assumption that whites could do a project on
race in the first place. 'Suspicious, hostile' are not too strong words
to use. Oh, my God, we were so far apart we couldn't even talk about it!
The distrust! I ended the meeting as quickly as I could."&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="arial,helvetica">Suspicions aroused</font></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">Black staffers were suspicious that their
white colleagues had an agenda&oacute;they wanted to report on black pathology.
What's wrong with blacks? Can't they get out of the projects? Why are so
many into crime?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Amoss recalls "a grudging feeling" at the
meeting on the part of some white editors who didn't like the way the discussions
were going. "In the end, it just fizzled, was a disaster," he said. "Blacks
sensed that we were treating the whole thing as just another topic coming
down the pike, not with the seriousness with which they thought it should
be invested. They became silent, sullen. The project seemed to be stillborn."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Afterwards, Gilger and Woods went to Amoss
and said they were concerned it wouldn't work. Woods, however, suggested
it might work if Amoss could get Nelson Hewitt, an African-American diversity
consultant, whom staffers of both races had come to trust during diversity
sessions, to return for intensive diversity sessions with the project team.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Amoss, a big supporter of earlier diversity
workshops, seized on Woods' idea and proposed it to Phelps. The publisher,
whose staunch support for the project was essential, never blinked. "Go
ahead," he told Amoss, and he authorized $30,000 for the sessions. Phelps,
a lawyer, had been publisher since 1979 and on the business side of the
paper since 1971 when his father, then the publisher, appointed him as
his assistant.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">For two days, Amoss recalls, he and the
project staff were closeted with Hewitt, the facilitator, in a hotel room,
where "he got us to talk about race relations and what our opinions were
and helped us break down some barriers."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The sessions were wrenching, especially
for white staffers, who recall either expressing or repressing guilt feelings.
"White women admitted that if a black man was walking down the street in
their direction, they might hold their purse and cross the street," said
Paula Devlin, the copy desk chief. "Some wouldn't admit that in their hearts
they felt the same way."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Like many of the staffers of both races,
Devlin, who is white, said the diversity sessions and working on the race
relations project "literally changed my life." She recalled the reaction
when Stephen Casmier, an African-American reporter, said he would "pay
a million dollars to have skin that was white."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"The mouths of all the whites in the room
dropped," she said, "but the other blacks nodded their heads up and down.
It made me ashamed of my skin. My life changed. My husband's life changed.
Race is every thing in this country, I'm much more aware of it now."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Kevin Bell, then a young black reporter
and seven years later a graduate student at New York University studying
for a Ph.D. in comparative literature, recalls that "racist attitudes,
some that were unconscious, emerged, and I don't think you would have had
the race relations series without the diversity sessions."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Not all the diversity sessions went smoothly.
After one exploded in arguments and bitter recriminations, Amoss called
a meeting of the staff and explained why white employees had to change
their attitudes toward black co-workers and why the newspaper had to do
a better job of writing for all its readers, not just whites. The paper
quoted Amoss as later saying: "To the extent that readers don't see themselves
and don't see their lives, their friends, their children and their activities
reflected in the paper, they feel shut out. And if people feel shut out,
a newspaper is failing in its mission, and ultimately will fail altogether."&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="arial,helvetica">A front-burner issue</font></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">For all of the diversity sessions, white
and black staffers sometimes found it difficult to work together. But in
discussions of the race relations project where whites and blacks generally
split along racial lines, whites could be found on the mostly black side
and vice versa. In fact, James O'Byrne, a white reporter who grew up in
Denver and New Orleans, aligned himself so regularly with Woods and other
blacks that the project staff, after attending the movie, "Malcolm X,"
nicknamed O'Byrne, "James O'X." O'Byrne recalls the staff's diversity sessions
as "a real defining moment in building the team."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"Blacks had the courage to talk in a friendly
and honest way and their brutal honesty commanded an honest response,"
he says. "Black folks face the race issue as a fact on the front-burner
every day of their lives. And they brought that home to us."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The team building and discussions about
what the project would cover and how it would be handled went on for four
to five months. Would it cover only current race relations? And if it delved
into the past, how far back would it go? As far back as the Jim Crow era
when laws sanctioned segregation or even back to the era of slavery? Would
it involve investigative reporting, digging into specific cases of discrimination?
Amoss said a crucial rule came out of it, proposed by Woods: <i>From then
on, every article on race would have to be "reviewed by a pair of African-American
eyes before publication."</i> Some editors "didn't take kindly" to the
rule, Amoss said. But the editor, described by his staff as soft-spoken,
but with a tough streak, enforced the rule.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">At a certain point in the discussion, some
black staffers argued that in reporting on institutional racism, the project
team would have to take a serious look at the <i>Times-Picayune</i>'s racist
past. Amoss's reaction, he recalls, was a gulp, followed by the words:
"Of course."&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="arial,helvetica">A look inward</font></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">It was not an easy decision for Amoss.
the <i>Times-Picayune</i>, like most Southern newspapers, had a long history
of supporting slavery before the Civil War and backing segregation through
the 1950s into the 1960s. Most members of the relatively young project
team had little idea of how racist the newspaper had been until they embarked
on the race relations series.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Amoss said, "The hardest decision was about
reporting on the newspaper itself and to be as searingly honest and true
to a history that could be seen in different ways, writing about an institution
we were part of and could be proud of and had to be sure of accuracy in
reporting on it."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Some staffers expected Phelps, the publisher,
to reject the idea of reporting on the newspaper's racist past. Mark Lorando,
the entertainment editor and a project team member, said, "People in the
newsroom were stunned that Phelps gave it the green light." Keith Woods
said, "The publisher must have lost consciousness when he learned we were
planning to do that story."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Could the paper really report on itself
fairly? Could it have done the series without doing the story about itself?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">It remains a sensitive subject for Ashton
Phelps Jr., especially because his father was publisher in the late 1960s
when the <i>Times-Picayune</i> gave short shrift to the civil rights movement.
He stresses that his father, who had been the newspaper's attorney until
being named publisher in 1967, "didn't control the editorial policy until
he became publisher." But the <i>Times-Picayune</i>, in its own article
on institutional racism, faulted the newspaper for not providing any leadership
on race until the 1970s when it "made its first halting changes."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Bill Minor, a white columnist who was the
paper's correspondent in Jackson, Miss., for 30 years, was quoted in the
<i>Times-Picayune</i>'s
story on the newspaper's record of covering race: "The <i>Picayune</i>
had a great opportunity and we didn't take it. Civil rights was the biggest
story of the day, and the <i>Picayune</i> didn't understand it." Minor
pointed out that 10 <i>New York Times</i> reporters were present, but he
was the sole <i>Times-Picayune</i> reporter on the scene when President
John F. Kennedy sent in federal marshals to control riots that broke out
in 1962 when James Meredith became the first black to enter the University
of Mississippi at Oxford. Minor, widely acclaimed for his own coverage
of civil rights, said he had begged for additional help to no avail. As
a stringer Minor wrote some civil rights articles that made big splashes
in <i>Newsweek</i> and the <i>New York Times</i>, but aroused little or
no interest at his own paper.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Before the 1970s the <i>Times-Picayune</i>
had only one black writer, who occasionally submitted stories about the
black community. Recalls Joyce Davis, a black woman hired as a reporter
in 1972 who became an editor at the <i>Times-Picayune</i> before leaving
in 1990 to become a National Public Radio editor in New York said, "I got
the sense I was just there to fill a space, and they were content just
to ignore me."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The paper hired a few more black reporters
in the early 1970s and was required to hire more black workers in several
departments under a consent decree the newspaper signed with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission to satisfy a job discrimination suit
brought against it.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Regardless of the paper's record on race
during his father's reign, however, Ashton Phelps Jr. stood solidly behind
the race relations project, including taking a hard look at the <i>Times-Picayune</i>.
"The only sit-down meeting I had with him on the project was over the story
on the paper," said Kristin Gilger, the project editor. "He never questioned
whether we should do it; he understood we had to do it. He saw the story
before it ran and he had comments about it. But he never tried to soft-pedal
anything. We did make a few changes on questions of fact because he knew
the paper's history."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Slavery was another subject that Keith
Woods and James Casmier, a black reporter, argued should be covered in
the series. Woods and Casmier&oacute;described by colleagues as the moral
compasses of the project team&oacute;met strong resistance from some white
reporters and editors who insisted that slavery was history and did not
fit the definition of news. They argued that slavery had been abolished
more than a century ago and was not germane to today's relations between
the races. Casmier countered that you could not understand race relations
without examining it in historic context, including slavery, the Jim Crow
era, and the civil rights movement.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Amoss eventually agreed. "We had been underestimating
our readers," he now says. "They were interested in the historic context."&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="arial,helvetica">The series runs</font></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">The series, entitled "Together Apart/The
Myth of Race," was published between May and November 1993. The series,
along with more than 1,000 responses by readers, ran in six huge installments
totaling 105 pages, an extraordinary and expensive allotment of space for
any newspaper. The articles' vivid depiction of racial discrimination and
rancorous race relations rocked the city. Thousands of phone calls and
other messages poured into the newspaper, a great majority of them from
white critics, many of them attacking the <i>Times-Picayune</i>.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Critics&oacute;not all of them rednecks
by any means&oacute;accused the paper of peddling guilt, of opening old
wounds, and of stirring racial animosity that could touch off a race riot.
The <i>Times-Picayune</i> was accused of exploiting the race issue in hopes
of winning a Pulitzer Prize. Many hate messages poured into the paper by
telephone and mail. A couple of them read as follows:&nbsp;</font>
<blockquote><font face="arial,helvetica">"Race relations is not the subject;
white racism, or perceived racism, is the subject.... You should be ashamed
of publishing the series. You are furthering the cause of the extremists
under the guise of public service." (David H. Lucien, <i>New Orleans Times-Picayune</i>,
Letters to the Editor, May 16, 1993.)&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"Surely you realize that [the series] can
only serve to exacerbate already strained race relations in this area.
I wish you had heeded the sage advice we all received as children: don't
pick a bo-bo or it won't heal." (Tom Haney, <i>New Orleans Times-Picayune</i>,
Letters to the Editor, July 4, 1993)&nbsp;</font></blockquote>
<font face="arial,helvetica">Undaunted, Phelps published a reprint of the
articles and the readers' responses. And in an accompanying letter he and
Amoss told readers the series had been published "in the hope of bringing
people together by talking unflinchingly about a subject that has us tongue-tied&oacute;race."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"We believe that racial discord remains
the gravest threat to the future of our community and nation and that honest
dialogue is a remedy to fear, mistrust and rage," Phelps and Amos wrote.
"'Together/Apart' is the most difficult story the <i>Times-Picayune</i>
has ever undertaken to tell. Our readers helped us, responding to our invitation
to speak up on race relations. Their 6,500 recorded telephone calls yielded
more than 1,000 published comments that appeared in 58 full newspaper pages
while the series ran. It is in their voices, presented here with our stories,
that we hear proof of the distance to be traveled to bridge the racial
divide. The going is painful. But we offer the following pages for those
who are willing to begin the journey."&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="arial,helvetica">A painful self-critique</font></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">The <i>Times-Picayune</i>'s report on
its own handling of the race question was written by Chris Adams, a white
reporter, who has since moved to the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>'s Washington
Bureau. Adams interviewed Phelps for the article, but found that the publisher
"didn't relish talking about it." Phelps, he said, "went off the record
40 times in a 35-minute interview to tell me trivial things."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Adams's article cited the Report of the
National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (the Kerner Commission)
of 25 years earlier, which concluded the news media "have failed to analyze
and report adequately on racial problems in the United States and, as a
related matter, to meet the Negro's legitimate expectations of journalism."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"By and large," the report said, "news
organizations have failed to communicate to both their black and white
audiences a sense of the problems America faces and the source of potential
solutions. The media report and write from the standpoint of a white man's
world."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The Kerner Commission, formed by President
Lyndon Johnson to investigate causes of the 1960s civil disorders and racial
unrest that rocked American cities, went on to observe, "It would be a
contribution of inestimable importance to race relations simply to treat
ordinary news about Negroes as news of other groups is now treated&oacute;in
all parts of the paper, from the news, society and club pages to the comic
strips."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Adams wrote that complaints were still
being lodged against the <i>Times-Picayune</i> for not covering African
Americans in all parts of the paper. While blacks were covered rather fully
in the news and feature sections, other sections still were disproportionately
white. A study of a month of society pages, for example, showed 96 percent
of the photos were of whites and 85 percent of brides and grooms listed
were white.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Phelps was quoted as saying that 66 percent
of black adults in the New Orleans area read the newspaper, one percentage
point less than the figure for all adults and higher than in other newspaper
markets. "I don't know a newspaper in the country that can't improve,"
he said, "but it would appear our team is doing some things right."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The <i>Times-Picayune</i>, 156 years old
when the series ran, had a long history of hostility, intolerance and insensitivity
when it came to race, Adams wrote, and the paper gave readers "an image
of black people as intellectually and morally inferior, relegated to a
lower social caste than white people and often little more than lazy or
criminal."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">During the 1800s, the newspaper's predecessor,
the daily Picayune, habitually demeaned black people as "besotted barbarians
full of natural dullness and cowardice." Slave owners were portrayed as
providing protection, kindness and comfort to "inferior Negroes" most of
whom were "content with their situation in life."&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="arial,helvetica">An eye-opener on slavery</font></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">The "Together Apart" series' coverage
of slavery was just as brutally frank and an eye opener to many blacks
as well as whites, who learned they lived in a city where&oacute;between
1804 and 1862&oacute;135,000 Africans were put on the auction block, more
than were auctioned anywhere else in the South.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The <i>Times-Picayune</i> published explicit
art of the slave trade: an 1850 etching of a slave auction in the rotunda
of the former St. Louis Hotel in New Orleans; a photo of a slave showing
huge scars from floggings, and an etching of a young black with his neck
gripped by a slave collar, described as "an iron band with bells," which
made it "painful and difficult for captives to move and enabled owners
to track them." The article noted the irony of Louisiana plantations thriving
on slave labor while New Orleans was fostering the largest community of
free people in the United States.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The newspaper gave a modern twist to the
slavery issue by contrasting the views of a woman whose ancestor owned
slaves with the views of a man whose ancestor was one of those slaves.
Mary Flower Pugh Russell, whose ancestor owned the Madewood sugar cane
plantation, which 250 slaves worked to maintain, said the slaves were treated
with kindness and provided adequate food and shelter. But Lionel Tap Sr.
related by marriage to Louisa Martin, who was enslaved at Madewood, said
that before Martin died she told him of whippings and beatings by cruel
overseers and owners, and of a life stunted by chains and hard labor.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The Jim Crow era, spanning more than 70
years after the Civil War, was described by the <i>Times-Picayune</i> as
"a long nightmare for African-Americans in the South and, for white people,
at least a partial revival of their slavery-era dominance. The period was
marked by lynchings, denial of voting rights and laws segregating everything
from water fountains to prostitutes."&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="arial,helvetica">Contemporary discrimination</font></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">Regarding contemporary discrimination,
the newspaper reported that African-Americans "cannot go where they want,
buy what they want or live where they want without fearing or feeling the
sting of discrimination that treats them as paupers and criminals."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"Sales clerks, real estate agents, landlords,
waiters and other service industry employees," it added, "often ignore,
suspect or charge higher prices to African-Americans in an updated form
of discrimination that is often subtle yet pervasive."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The paper reported on a pattern of discrimination
in house rentals and car sales by sending both black and white reporters
out to test the market. But editors chose not to identify the landlords
or car dealers who were guilty of discrimination. They explained they thought
it would be unfair to single out individuals who discriminated since it
was believed to be a widespread practice even though the <i>Times-Picayune</i>
did not do a comprehensive survey or investigation of the matter. The failure
to name names led some staffers to complain the reports were not tough
enough.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The paper also noted that 39 years after
the Supreme Court's desegregation ruling in <i>Brown v Board of Education</i>,
New Orleans' schools were "integrated in name only." A chart showing the
most segregated major U. S. school districts&oacute;when at least 9 of
10 students are of a single race&oacute;listed New Orleans third with an
88 rating. Washington was first with 96 and Atlanta second with 92.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The series included several stories about
racial progress, including interracial communication and cooperation and
efforts by some groups to improve racial relations. But black staffers
generally were cool to such stories, feeling they tended to put a happy
face on an ugly problem, and those kind of stories amounted to only a small
portion of the series.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="arial,helvetica">The response</font></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">Although the "Together Apart" series drew
an unprecedented response from readers and was the talk of the town for
months, the New Orleans establishment reacted in cold silence. No religious
or business group or any other organized group spoke up in support of the
<i>Times-Picayune</i>'s
argument that New Orleans needed to mount a major dialogue on "the gravest
threat to the future of our community and nation." Perhaps, some would
think later, the silence was because the coverage included a hard look
at the racism of such institutions as business, industry, religion and
education.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The largely negative reader response shocked
Kristin Gilger, the project leader. She read transcripts of all 6,500 "Speak
Up" calls recorded by the paper and "felt every day I was being showered
with hate, not just transcripts, but letters, tons of letters."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"The level of hatred astonished me," she
said. "My father's Archie Bunker; it's not like I wasn't exposed to racism
before. Ninety percent of the hatred came from whites. So little of it
came from the blacks."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The reaction of the staff was divided,
too. Gilger devoted most of her time to reviewing and editing "Speak Up"
even though she had been designated editor of the overall project. It was
just as well. The publisher, editor, and managing editor were all involved
in the series, and the project staff was loosely structured, with other
editors, as well as some reporters, taking part in the editing process.
Several different people would make small editing decisions on a single
article. The group dynamic was "slow and difficult," Gilger said. "You
had to reach a consensus on everything and you would get tired of it."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Several other staffers complained that
the editing process was cumbersome and frustrating. Coleman Warner, a white
reporter from Meridian, Miss., said, "Too many people had a say about the
tone of the stories, and many changes were made in the stories along the
way."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Warner, who wrote the story about contrasting
views concerning the treatment of slaves, had what he described as a "heated
argument" with Keith Woods about the way his story quoted Mary Flower Pugh
Russell, the white woman, in describing her view about slavery. In editing
the story, Woods wanted to suggest that the woman's view that owners protected
and took good care of slaves could not be true. Warner, who had located
the woman and persuaded her to cooperate, thought she was entitled to her
unvarnished view and sarcastically suggested the city editor just call
her a "liar" if he didn't think she believed what she said. Warner said
Woods eventually edited the story to his satisfaction, but that he found
that incident and other parts of the editing process "physically and mentally
exhausting."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Woods agrees his editing, which juxtaposed
slave descendent Lionel Tap's views of harsh treatment with Russell's views,
was "a good outcome" to end the dispute with Warner. But Wood says he felt
strongly reporters should "make sure we didn't just allow people to make
categorical statements that were immoral and wrong without in some way
indicating were we stood on those issues."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">At times when the project staff divided
pretty much along racial lines, Peter Kovacs, the managing editor, "tried
to keep feet in both camps" to keep from being frozen out by either faction.
He worried about hard feelings and philosophical differences among the
staffers concerning how much hopefulness the series should reflect. And
the differences didn't cut entirely along racial lines; mostly it was whites
who thought the series should have been more hopeful or optimistic than
it was.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="arial,helvetica">Community's conscience raised</font></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">While some who worked on the project thought
it resulted in little in the way of concrete changes, the consensus of
those looking back on it with six years of hindsight is that while it was
extremely difficult and time-consuming to execute, it was a worthy endeavor
that raised the community's consciousness on racial issues and to some
extent helped change the newsroom culture. As Mark Lorando said, "Now people
can approach the race issue with a candor that was not there before."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">African-Americans are covered more thoroughly
throughout much of the paper now. Stories and photographs of African-Americans
in all walks of life&oacute;not just the stereotypical roles assigned to
them of athletes, entertainers, or criminal suspects&oacute;now appear
throughout the paper. Black business and professional leaders are often
quoted and pictured in the paper. While many papers abolished their society
papers, Jim Amoss points out the <i>Times-Picayune</i> opted for diversification
because it brought higher circulation penetration of the black community.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Also the perspectives of African-American
editors or reporters are sought before publishing stories when race is
an issue. After the series was published the <i>Times-Picayune</i> discontinued
its policy of publishing photographs of handcuffed prisoners who were regularly
paraded in front of news cameras by New Orleans police. A great majority
of the prisoners were black; white prisoners usually had lawyers to protect
them from such staged photographs.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">African-American editors also began to
have more influence on how the <i>Times-Picayune</i> played some stories
involving blacks. James O'Byrne cites two cases in which stories that had
been scheduled to appear inside the paper were instead placed on page one
after Terry Baquet, the assistant Sunday editor, argued they involved news
that was important, especially to the black community. One case involved
an obituary of Avery Alexander, a militant black civil rights leader, and
the other was about the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charging
a white auto dealer with abusing black employees. In both cases, O'Byrne
said, the articles would have remained inside the paper where white editors
had consigned them had Baquet not argued about their importance to black
readers.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Editors also now enforce a rule in the
<i>Times-Picayune</i>
stylebook providing that people be identified by race or ethnic origin
only when such identification is relevant to the story. And when such identifications
are used stories must offer explicit reasons why identifying race or ethnic
origin is important.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="arial,helvetica">Staff exhausted</font></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">Most project staffers, white and black,
agree that the series left them feeling exhausted and glad the project
had ended. Lisa Frazier, a black reporter who is now with the <i>Washington
Post</i>, said, "Oh God, we were all mentally and emotionally exhausted."
Mark Lorando said: "I tend to shudder a little when I think back on it.
The diversity workshops and the series were all consuming. It created tensions
at home and was hard on my marriage. The diversity workshops were valuable,
but divided the newsroom between pro-diversity and those who were angry
about it and considered the sessions brainwashing. Some people thought
the race relations project was a horrible idea."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Coleman Warner and his wife both "wanted
it over with."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"I wasn't ashamed of the series or my part
in it," he said, "but I wanted to put a stake through it. I was proud of
most of it and what Amoss and Phelps were willing to attempt in this arena.
Execution of it was the problem."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The series caused about 1,000 angry readers
to cancel their subscriptions, according to Amoss. Phelps confirms some
subscriptions were cancelled, but downplays the number and significance
of any cancellations and says the series resulted in no loss of advertising.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">In the long term, the series had relatively
little impact on the circulation, but Amos and Phelps both stress that
the newspaper's circulation penetration in the mostly black community is
almost as great as in the mostly white community.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Phelps also tended to downplay threats
of one kind or another that some angry critics telephoned to the paper.
"Jim Amoss and I were committed to 'Together Apart'," he said, "and those
who knew us may have known that threats would not produce any desired results.
Also, the 'Speak Up' reader feedback feature may have channeled to that
source calls that would have normally gone to the editor or publisher.
I do not remember any significant threats in spite of the controversial
nature of the series."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The <i>Times-Picayune</i>'s series was
a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize, but the prize was awarded to the <i>Akron
Beacon-Journal</i>, for another series on race relations that was shorter
and more analytical. Although The <i>Times Picayune</i> did win a Pulitzer
Prize for public service in 1997 for a series on the Gulf of Mexico's pollution
problems, Phelps still sees the race relations series as "the most significant
work we've ever done."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Phelps also thinks "the most amazing thing"
about it was the reader feedback. "Not to take anything away from the fine
reporting," he said, "but in 29 years I had never before seen readers read
back-to-back pages and respond that way."&nbsp;</font>
