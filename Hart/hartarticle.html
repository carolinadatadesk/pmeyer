<center><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+3>THE GARY HART STORY:</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+3>HOW IT HAPPENED</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><i>This article was prepared by Jim McGee, Tom Fiedler and James
Savage. It was first published in The Miami Herald on May 10, 1987.&nbsp;
It is reprinted with permission of The Miami Herald.</i></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The voice on the other end of the telephone was strained with a nervous
jocularity.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“You know, you said in the paper that there were rumors that Gary Hart
is a womanizer, ” he woman told Miami Herald Political Editor Tom Fiedler.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Those aren't rumors. How much do you guys pay for pictures?”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;Gary Hart, 50, announced
his quest for the presidency April 13 at the foot of the Rocky Mountains
with a promise as lofty as the backdrop: “All of us must try to hold ourselves
to the very highest standards of integrity and ethics, and soundness of
judgment... ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He began as the front-runner with everything in his favor. Polls showed
him not only winning the Democratic nomination, but handily beating George
Bush -- the GOP’s early favorite -- in a theoretical matchup.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The former Colorado senator surrounded himself with the brightest minds
in politics. He showed a new surefootedness, the product of having run
the course once before, in 1984. The gold ring seemed within reach.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;And the voice on the telephone
was offering evidence to The Herald that could undo it all.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The call was the beginning of one of the fastest, most shocking unravelings
of a presidential campaign in American history. The saga has elements of
a prime-time soap opera: the Marlboro-man handsome candidate, the long-suffering
wife, the lust for power, the blond poster model from Miami Vice, the overnight
trip to Bimini --capped by a weekend in Washington.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The story also epitomized the painful collision between a person’s privacy
and the voters' need to know. In following a tip, The Herald involved himself
in a controversial stakeout.&nbsp; Later, while The Herald concentrated
on reporting what it saw, Hart's followers focused on what the reporters
might have missed. Even now, the newspaper concedes that the watch was
not airtight (Story, Page 14A.).</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the end to Hart’s campaign came at noon Friday, there remained the
elements of Greek tragedy. The gifted hero who had taunted the press to
“follow me around . . . it will be boring” was felled by hubris.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Gary Hart is having an affair with a friend of mine, ” the caller said,
leveling a charge that the pair has denied.&nbsp; “We don't need another
president who lies like that.”</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>RUMORS OF WOMANIZING</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The story behind the story began two weeks before the call, on the day
Hart formally announced that he was a candidate. A profile in Newsweek
that week made passing reference to his troubled 28-year marriage to Lee
and to rumors of infidelity. A former adviser was quoted as saying that
Hart could have a problem in this campaign “if he can't keep his pants
on. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The article triggered a barrage of similar stories in other newspapers.
Suddenly, the candidate who promised to fashion a campaign on the power
of his intellect was dealing with charges about the power of his libido.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet no article backed up the allegation with an accusation. “It's hard
to disprove rumors if you don't know where they come from, ” Hart complained
to Fiedler, who has covered him since 1984.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fiedler, 41, is a 16-year veteran journalist who first tasted national
politics when assigned to cover part of the 1972 George Wallace campaign.
He dealt with both Hart's problem and the journalistic ethical questions
it raised in a lengthy front- page article. On balance, the Monday, April
27, article was sympathetic to Hart’s plight:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“If I was editing Newsweek, ” it quoted journalism professor Bruce Swain
as saying, “I might have put a reporter on (the womanizing rumors) for
a week to see if we could either report it directly, or dispatch it.”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fiedler wrote: “In a harsh light, the media reports themselves are rumor-mongering,
pure and simple. ”</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>THE CALLER</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fiedler stayed later than normal that Monday wading through papers accumulated
from a routine political reporting trip to several cities. He was about
to leave about 8 p.m. when his telephone rang.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At first the caller seemed to be taunting him, refusing to give her name
but hinting that she had a secret she might let him share. The caller had
read the article and seemed alternately outraged and amused by Hart's statements
of being an innocent victim of rumors.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
She had proof that Hart was having an affair, she said. Then, with a nervous
laugh, she asked how much The Herald was willing to pay for a picture.
To Fiedler, this was just another crank call he was in no mood to take.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He told her he resented her mocking tone. If what she said was true, Fiedler
said, then she had better pause and consider the gravity of her charge.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
She asked whether Hart might win the nomination and the election. He told
her about the polls. She asked whether she could stay anonymous. He said
he saw no need to learn her name if she gave him information that he could
confirm independently.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;Fiedler told her to sleep
on it and call him back if she wanted to proceed on that basis.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On Tuesday morning at 10:30, his telephone rang again. It was the caller.
There was no jocularity. She was nervous but intent on helping. She was
a “liberal Democrat, ” she said, but she couldn't tolerate someone who
would say one thing publicly and do another privately. The nation had just
seen that happen with President Reagan and the Iranian arms sales, she
said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The details of the alleged relationship emerged during that 90-minute call,
terminated only because she had an appointment to keep.&nbsp; She placed
Hart and an “older man named Bill who said he was Hart’s lawyer” at a yacht
party several weeks before.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As many as 50 people -- most of them involved in acting, modeling or the
music business - - partied on the yacht, she said. “They weren't the kind
of people you would think a presidential candidate would want to be around,
” the caller said, admitting that she was among them.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hart was initially attracted to her, the caller said, but she rebuffed
him, disgusted by his demeanor. Her friend, however, seemed fascinated
by him.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“They spent a lot of time together that day, and when we left she gave
him her phone number, ” the caller said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hart acted on the gesture. He called and invited the friend out on “a cruise,
” she said. They went somewhere and stopped in a port overnight, but the
caller didn't know where. She knew only that her friend was by then enthralled
with Hart and in the weeks that followed eagerly displayed pictures of
the pair together at that port.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These were the pictures she wanted to sell the night before, she said.
Fiedler still declined. “Politicians have their pictures taken with strangers
all the time, ” he said. “It proves nothing. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then, the woman said, there were all the telephone calls. Hart called frequently
from the campaign trail, saying each time where he was and where he was
headed. The caller knew the places from which the calls came: Georgia,
Alabama, Kansas. She knew the dates.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the most recent calls, the woman said, Hart had invited her friend to
spend the coming weekend with him at his townhouse in Washington. They
were to meet Friday night.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The caller demanded to stay out of the story and continued to withhold
her name. But she was sure that if Fiedler would only meet her friend and
chat for about 20 minutes, the friend would tell him everything about her
fling with Hart. “She's really outgoing, ” the callersaid. “Maybe you could
fly to Washington on the plane and get the seat next to her? ”</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="FIEDLER_TOM.jpg" height=151 width=161 align=LEFT>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Tom
Fiedler)</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fine, Fiedler said. He asked for the flight information.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I'll get it and call you back, ” she said. It was 12:15 p.m. Tuesday.
She didn't call back.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>CHECKING IT OUT</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fiedler began checking the caller's information against Hart's schedule.&nbsp;
Every date and place squared. Hart, indeed, had stayed in Miami the weekend
of the yacht party following a fund- raiser at the home of Miami lawyer
Joel Karp.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The caller fixed the date of the yacht party by remembering she had attended
the movie premier of Making Mr. Right on Miami Beach the night before.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fiedler was impressed with the accuracy of much of what he had been given.
But he knew it remained conceivable that a campaign dirty trickster could
have gotten Hart's schedule and elaborately fabricated the story.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There remained three points that seemed wrong to him.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First, the caller said Hart and her friend were to meet in Washington on
Friday night and would be at Hart’s townhouse. The copy of Hart's schedule
available to Fiedler showed that Hart was to be in Iowa on Friday and in
Kentucky on Saturday for a Kentucky Derby party.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Second, Fiedler also thought Hart lived in Bethesda, Md., not in Washington.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And third, he was baffled by the caller's description of “Bill, ” the man
with Hart. Normally, Hart travels with Bill Shore, a man in his mid-30s.
The caller said this Bill was “really old looking. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nonetheless, Fiedler informed City Editor John Bracer and Investigations
Editor James Savage of the call. He let his doubts go, expecting another
call.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By Friday, the continuing silence became tormenting. Fiedler was tethered
to his phone, hoping it would ring. He decided to try to assuage his minor
doubts. Fiedler telephoned Hart headquarters in Denver and asked for the
candidate's weekend schedule, saying that he might want to go to the Kentucky
event to cover Hart.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Kentucky stop has been scrubbed, Hart’s scheduler said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Where is he going to be this weekend?” Fiedler asked.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“He's going to take some time off in Washington, ” came the reply.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Where does he stay in Washington? Does he still have his house in Bethesda?
” Fiedler asked.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“No. They've sold that. They have a townhouse on Capitol Hill.”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fiedler's mind pictured a slot machine with everything lining up. He rushed
to pass the information on to Savage.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>GO OR NO GO?</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What Fiedler learned from the caller persuaded Savage, 47, that the tip
was worth pursuing.&nbsp; But without a flight number - - indeed, without
the address of Hart's townhouse -- it wasn't clear how to pursue it. There
were five flights between Miami and Washington that Friday night. The woman
was to be on one of them.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But which one? How do you spot her? The caller said she was blond, in her
late 20s, with a rich Southern drawl. She was an actress with an appearance
on Miami Vice to her credit. That was not enough to go on. And even if
she is seen on the plane, what then?</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Savage summoned investigative reporter Jim McGee, 34, into his office a
few minutes before 5 p.m. that Friday. By then, Hart was in the air between
Iowa to Washington. If the caller was right, the Miami woman would be leaving
at any time to join him.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee asked Fiedler to describe the phone call again.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Do you believe her? ” McGee asked.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Yes, ” Fiedler said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee went back to Savage.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“It feels right, ” McGee said.&nbsp; “I say let's do it.”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Savage said. “Let's go. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of the five flights, only two were nonstop. McGee guessed that the woman
would catch one of those, narrowing the odds. The first left Miami at 5:30;
the next at 7:40. It was then 5 p.m.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With just a credit card and the clothes he wore, McGee ran out of the Herald
building and, luckily, immediately saw an empty cab at the nearest intersection.&nbsp;
“If there had been two red lights, he would have missed the plane,” Savage
said later.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Fiedler was coming up dry in finding Hart’s address. His calls
kept coming back, "Bethesda. ” Then, as McGee raced to the airport, a Senate
staff member called Fiedler on an unrelated matter.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“By the way, do you know where Gary Hart lives? ” Fiedler asked Ken Klein,
press secretary to Sen. Bob Graham.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Sure, ” Klieg said. “Buddy Shorestein (Graham's chief of staff) rents
the basement apartment from him. ”</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>FLIGHT TO WASHINGTON</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee ran through Miami International Airport and reached the gate in time
to hear the final boarding call for Eastern Flight 996.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>That's when he first saw the
woman with shoulder-length blond hair. She was standing at the ticket counter,
and she was stunning. Hanging from her arms was a bulky, distinctive purse,
with&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>shiny stripes across a dark
background. She seemed to be in the company of another young woman, also
blond, but not as attractive.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the airplane, McGee sat in seat 19D. Across the aisle and a few rows
ahead sat the blond woman with the purse. Farther forward, near the bulkhead,
sat her friend from the counter. McGee noticed a third blond woman on the
plane who was also attractive, but seemed younger.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee figured that either the woman with the purse or the younger woman
was most likely to be an actress. He wondered how he would decide which
woman to follow.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During the flight, McGee walked up the aisle twice, passing each woman
slowly to fix her face in his mind. At one point, the woman with the purse
rose from her seat and walked toward her friend near the bulkhead. They
arranged to sit next to each other and for the rest of the flight talked
animatedly.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The jet landed at 8:01 p.m. at Washington's National Airport. McGee caught
up with the blond woman with the purse as she reached the baggage claim
area.&nbsp; She was greeted by a woman friend, a brunet.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The younger blond was met by a young man in his 20s. They joined in a passionate
embrace.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There was no Gary Hart. No chauffeur. Nobody who looked like a campaign
aide. McGee feared he had taken the wrong flight.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He walked to a pay telephone and dialed the Knight-Ridder Bureau in Washington.
He was put through to News Editor Douglas Clifton, 44, who had just transferred
to Washington from The Herald. Fiedler had given Clifton the Hart townhouse
address, and Clifton&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>relayed it to McGee. He told
him he would help watch Hart’s home. Clifton agreed to meet him later in
the evening.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee took a cab from the airport and got out at Sixth and E, SE. He walked
around the block once and came up the back alley behind Hart's house.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From what he could see, it would not be easy to remain undetected while
watching Hart's house. It sat in the middle of a dense row of townhouses
that sat back from a picturesque, but intimate, residential street. It
was brightly lit by streetlights. People walked their dogs at all hours.
And there was a steady flow of car traffic.</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="CLIFTON_DOUG.jpg" height=219 width=167 align=LEFT>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Doug
Clifton)</font>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There was a city park one block away with benches positioned so that McGee
could see whether anyone came or went from the front of Hart's townhouse.
Facing the park was a District of Columbia police station.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>THE OBSERVATIONS</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
About 9:30 p.m., McGee was across the street and roughly six doors from
Hart's home when he heard a sound. It might have been the front door opening.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From Hart's townhouse emerged a trim, well-built man with black hair. He
wore a white long-sleeve dress shirt and dark slacks. With him was a blond
woman.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee could see the woman clearly. She had the same blond hair he had seen
up close at the ticket counter in Miami. She was wearing the same clothes
he had seen on the plane. She was carrying the same purse.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The man was Gary Hart.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee, who had never expected to see the woman from the plane again, was
stunned. He couldn't believe it was the same woman.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;The anonymous tip was becoming
a news story. And events were moving faster than anyone had anticipated.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee rushed toward a pay telephone a block away to call editors in Miami.
It was 9:33 p.m.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee reached Executive Editor Heath Meriwether at home. The tip was checking
out, McGee said. Was McGee sure? Yes, he said, he had just seen Hart with
a woman who had flown from Miami on his flight. She fit the description
given by the source. We need more reporters, McGee said; we need a photographer.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee called Savage, who wasn't home, and Fiedler, who was dumbfounded
by the news. Fiedler said he’d get on the next plane out. But there were
no more flights to Washington that night. There would be no additional
help until the next day.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee returned to Hart's street. Clifton, the Knight-Ridder news editor,
arrived about 10 p.m. and took up a position in the rear.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An hour passed. McGee and Clifton conferred and decided that two men hanging
around a&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>neighborhood were too obvious.
Clifton took a cab to National Airport to rent a car.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee called Savage, who was arranging for photographer Brian Smith and
Fiedler to join Savage on the first plane in the morning.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As he spoke on the telephone, McGee caught sight of something moving out
of the corner of his eye. He glanced up the street, and the series of coincidences
that drove the story, continued.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee spotted Hart's car driving slowly through the intersection.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I think I see them again, ” he told Savage. He hung up the phone and ran
back to the street.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee slowed to a quick stroll as he approached Hart’s house. It was 11:17
p.m.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hart had parked his car around the corner and was walking toward the front
door with the blond woman.&nbsp; McGee, walking toward him but on the other
side of the street, could distinctly see Hart and the blond woman. The
same purse glinted under the street light.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hart said later that the woman left in 15 to 20 minutes. McGee was alone
outside. He did not see her leave from the front entrance. Clifton was
returning from the airport with the rental car.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>THE WATCH</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Saturday dawned as a bright spring day, warm with the scent of flowers
in the air. The neighborhood around Hart's townhouse awoke early.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the early hours, Clifton watched the front while McGee watched the back
street.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Investigations Editor Savage, photographer Smith and reporter Fiedler caught
pre-dawn flights to Washington and discussed their objectives during the
flight.&nbsp; Fiedler circled a passage in a New York Times Magazine article
slated for Sunday publication and handed it to Savage.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Follow me around, I don't care, ” Hart was quoted as saying. “I'm serious.
If anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They'd be very, bored.
”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
They arrived in Washington at 10:05 a.m. and reached the street in front
of Hart's townhouse about 11. Smith and Savage parked on opposite corners
with a clear view of Hart's car, but a partially obstructed view of the
front door. Fiedler parked on the street behind the townhouse, where he
could watch the alley entrance.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The reporters considered it crucial that at least one other staff member
identify Hart and the woman to confirm what McGee had seen the night before.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Later, Hart denounced the watch as “spotty. ” McGee was alone while Clifton
went for the car Friday night, no one was watching the townhouse from 3
a.m. to 5 a.m., the back entrance wasn't covered at all time, and the view
of the front door was sometimes blocked.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The reporters never considered the stakeout airtight. The words “around
the clock” surveillance were struck from the story’s initial draft.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;“It’s possible” the woman
could have slipped out of the house, Savage later told The New York Times.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In midafternoon, there was a flurry of activity outside the Hart townhouse
involving a maroon sedan that double-parked in front. Smith hurriedly took
up pursuit of the car.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It traveled a few blocks and parked in front of a church. A couple - -
definitely not Hart and the blond woman - - got out. “False alarm, ” Smith
said.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>THE DISCOVERY</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At 8:40 p.m., the front of the townhouse was bathed in the orange glow
of security lighting.&nbsp; The back street remained dark, shaded by large
trees. McGee strolled toward the rear alley driveway.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He stopped in his tracks as he saw Hart and the blond woman emerge from
the alley that led to Hart's garage entrance. McGee turned on his heels,
picked up his pace, walked past the alley and headed toward the corner
where Hart's car was parked.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As he rounded the corner, Fiedler, who had changed into a running outfit,
jogged by him. “He's right behind me, ” McGee whispered hoarsely. Fiedler,
who knows Hart from the campaign trail, crossed the street to the park
to avoid recognition.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hart's hands were thrust in his pockets, and he looked rapidly about the
neighborhood. The blond woman clutched his right arm as they walked.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hart appeared on guard. He walked a few feet, stopped, then walked on.
When he and the woman reached his car, instead of getting inside, they
turned and retreated down the block and into the front entrance.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“He might have recognized me from last night, ” McGee told Savage.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Minutes later, Hart emerged alone, strode directly to his car, got in and
pulled into traffic. Smith, the photographer, followed Hart in his car.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;Hart went only a few blocks
more before parking and walking back toward his block, although not directly.
He walked down a side street, turned a corner and promptly sat down. Clifton,
following about 50 feet behind him, turned the corner and encountered Hart
looking directly at him.&nbsp; Clifton continued on.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hart again circled the block, this time approaching his townhouse toward
his front door. He walked directly past the car in which McGee and Savage
sat. To them, he seemed agitated. He appeared to yell over his shoulder
toward someone on the other side of the street.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When Hart entered the alley behind his townhouse, Savage turned to McGee.
“I think we should talk to him right now. ” Hart clearly knew he was being
watched.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“It's your call, ” Savage said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Let's do it, ” said McGee.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>THE CONFRONTATION</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee and Savage walked up the dark alley following Hart. McGee turned
the corner at the end of the alley and flinched in surprise. Gary Hart
stood directly around the corner, leaning against a brick fence. Both men
were startled.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Good evening, Senator, ” McGee said.&nbsp; “I'm a reporter from The Miami
Herald. We'd like to talk to you. ” Savage introduced himself.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;Hart said nothing. He held
his arms around his midsection and leaned forward slightly with his back
against the brick wall. He was wearing a white sweater jacket and slacks.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We’d like to ask you about the young woman staying in your house, McGee
said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“No one is staying in my house, ” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We saw a woman go in your house at 8:40 p.m. You passed me on the street
here, McGee said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I may or may not have, ” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What is your relationship with the woman in your townhouse? McGee asked.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I'm not involved in any relationship, ” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So why did we just see her and you go back into the townhouse?</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“The obvious reason is I'm being set up, ” Hart said. His voice quivered.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is she in your house, Senator?</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“She may or may not be,” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Savage asked whether they could go to his house to meet the young woman
and continue the interview. Hart refused.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If she is not in your house, how did she leave?&nbsp; Is she staying with
you?</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“She's been here in Washington over the weekend, ” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Senator, let me explain, McGee said. We've had your house under surveillance
since early last evening.&nbsp; I was standing near the front of your house
last night at 9:30 p.m. I saw you come out of your house with a blond woman.
You got into your car, you drove up the street, you got stopped at the
red light. I walked alongside your car.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hart listened, occasionally nodding his head.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Senator, where were you going?</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I was on my way to take her to a place where she was staying, ” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Savage cut in: How long have you known her?</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Several months, ” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What is her name?</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I would suppose you would find that out. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee: Senator, at 11:17 p.m. I was again directly across from the front
of your house and I saw you come walking up the street with the blond woman.
You had parked your car at the corner and you walked up the street and
entered your house.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“She came back to pick up some things that she had left, ” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How long did she stay?</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Ten or 15 minutes,” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How did she leave? Savage asked.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I don't remember. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Senator, this is important. Can you remember how she left? Is it possible
you called a cab for her? Savage asked.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I don't remember, ” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who is this woman? McGee asked.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“She is a friend of a friend of mine, ” Hart said. “ . . . A guest of a
friend of mine.”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee said he didn't understand. He went over the last observation again.
Tell us again why they returned together.</font></font></b>

<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><b><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;
(Donna Rice)&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“She left some things in the house, ” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Savage broke in: What is the nature of your relationship? “I have no relationship
with the woman, ” Hart said. “She is not staying with me.” It was, he said,
“nothing personal. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hart seemed to gain composure as he spoke.&nbsp; Fiedler joined the interview.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Hi, Tom,” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We know you made telephone calls to this woman from around the country,
McGee said, from various campaign stops.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What did you talk about?</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Nothing, ” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Were they political? McGee asked.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“It was casual, political, ” Hart said.&nbsp; "General conversation. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Savage asked when he first met her.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“To my recollection I don't remember where I met her, ” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Did he know her occupation?</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I don't know that, either. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fiedler said the reporters knew that he was with her on a yacht, a trip
he took after a campaign stop in Gainesville.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I don't remember, ” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You have never been on that yacht then? McGee asked.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I didn't say that, ” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During the next few minutes, first Fiedler and then McGee reminded Hart
of his challenge to the press to follow him around. They pointed out that
after the Newsweek article he had said he could only respond to specifics,
not rumors. The reporters were now asking about a specific incident. Fiedler,
who had covered the opening of his campaign in Colorado, reminded him that
he had promised to conduct his campaign on the highest moral plane.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He implored Hart to offer evidence that would clarify the situation. He
said, “You, of all people, know the sensitivity of this. ” And he told
Hart that The Herald intended to publish an account of what the reporters
had witnessed and what Hart had confirmed. Please be forthcoming, Fiedler
said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I've been very forthcoming, ” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What is your relationship with the blond woman?</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I have no personal relationship with the individual you are following,
” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Are you denying that you met her on the yacht? McGee asked.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I’m not denying anything, ” Hart said heatedly.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Savage asked Hart whether he would allow reporters to talk with the woman
in his house.&nbsp; That&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>would clear up the questions.&nbsp;
Hart said he did not want to violate her privacy.&nbsp; How about the friend
she is visiting? Savage asked. Same problem, Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee explained that if there was an innocent explanation, produce the
woman. Let us talk to her.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I don't have to produce anyone, ” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee had long ago learned to save the least pleasant question for last.
Hart acted as if he were close to ending the interview.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Have you had sex with the woman I saw with you on the street? McGee asked.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“The answer is no,” Hart said. “I'm not going to get into all that.”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hart abruptly terminated the interview by turning and walking back toward
the entrance to his house.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“We don't need any of that, ” Hart said, starting up the alley to his house,
as photographer Smith snapped several shots.</font></font></b>
