<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By now it was after 10 p.m., fast approaching deadline for the bulk of
The Herald's Sunday press run. In the confrontation interview, Hart had
confirmed the essential elements that the reporters felt were needed to
confirm the personal relationship that the caller had said existed.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hart had adamantly refused to allow the reporters to talk with the woman
to support his claim that she was merely a “friend of a friend. ” He said
the woman was staying at a friend's house but refused to name that friend.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fiedler, Savage and McGee went directly back to Fiedler's room at the Quality
Inn and marshaled their notes to produce a story.&nbsp; At the hotel, McGee
telephoned Meriwether in Miami and outlined what the reporters felt they
could produce. Meriwether drove to The Herald to oversee its publication.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The story was written by Fiedler as McGee transcribed notes from the Hart
interview. Fiedler sat down at his portable computer terminal and typed
a hard and blunt opening paragraph that Hart “spent Friday night and most
of Saturday” with a young woman from Miami. The lead brought the newspaper
intense criticism.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While Fiedler and McGee wrote, Savage answered the phone.&nbsp; A man identifying
himself as Bill Broadhurst, demanded to speak with Fiedler. He said he
could vouch for Hart.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He said the woman was his houseguest, not Hart's.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The situation was “innocent,” he told Savage. The blond seen with Hart
was in Washington to accompany a second Miami woman who was staying at
Broadhurst's home while considering taking a job with him as a social director
for his lobbying and entertaining operations.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Savage ordered Broadhurst's version included in the story. Broadhurst refused
to name the women.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Savage attempted to get Broadhurst to provide details about the movements
of Hart and his woman friend from Broadhurst's house to Hart's.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“You have now told me three times that the two women spent the night at
your house. We'll include that in the story. Now I just want you to take
me step by step through what happened since Friday, ” Savage told Broadhurst.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Again, Broadhurst repeated that the woman had left Hart's house Friday
night, had spent the night at his house with her friend. He declined to
provide additional details; he wanted to talk to Fiedler.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When Savage asked him to detail their movements Saturday, Broadhurst said
he “had not worn his watch Saturday” and was therefore unable to provide
any details of when he and the two women came to or left from Hart's townhouse.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Savage asked Broadhurst to put the women on the phone. Broadhurst refused.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Savage decided that the only thing Broadhurst was willing to provide for
the story was the general statement that the two women had stayed with
him. He turned the phone over to Fiedler.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Broadhurst, 48, a powerful lawyer with political connections in Louisiana
and Washington, wanted to negotiate a delay in the story. Fiedler took
the phone while the story was being edited. Broadhurst urged him to come
over to his Capitol Hill townhouse to talk things out.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This conversation formed the basis of sharp disagreement.&nbsp; Broadhurst
told Fiedler that, if he came right over, “the girls” would be there.&nbsp;
Broadhurst claimed later that he offered to let the reporters interview
the women.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fiedler, however, felt Broadhurst's offer came with a huge escape clause
- - the women might be there, but they would refuse to answer questions.
Broadhurst was evasive when asked about that point. He said he could not
compel them to talk.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fiedler told Broadhurst he would call him back later.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In Miami, Meriwether gave the go-ahead. “The key was the interview with
Hart and our entreaties to him to please let us talk to the woman or anyone
else who could explain what we had seen. . . . (Hart) didn't need 24 hours
to explain what we'd seen. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meanwhile, the lone unanswered doubt raised by Fiedler's original woman
caller vanished with Broadhurst's call. The lawyer known to friends as
“Billy B” was the “old-looking Bill” who had been with Hart at the Miami
yacht party.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>HART CAMPAIGN REACTS</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Minutes after the story cleared, Fiedler called Broadhurst and asked to
come over to meet the houseguests. Broadhurst balked: “Your story is already
written. I don't see any point in that, ” he said. Besides, he added, the
women now were asleep.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He offered instead to pick up the reporters and join them for dinner at
an all-night restaurant. Broadhurst arrived minutes later. The four found
their way to Washington’s Chinatown.&nbsp; Broadhurst conceded that he
and Hart were with the two women on the yacht in Miami. He said it was
a coincidence that Hart and the blond ended up together in Washington over
the weekend, something Hart himself and she would contradict later.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But Broadhurst was clear on several points. The blond woman was invited
to Washington for the weekend by his guest, a second woman who was interviewing
for a job on his staff. Broadhurst, a man with an engaging Louisiana drawl,
said he was unaware of the telephone calls Hart admitted making to the
woman.</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="rice_060287ap.jpg" height=200 width=142 align=LEFT>
<br><b><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rice and Hart&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“God damn,” he said, sitting back in his chair at the Chinese restaurant.&nbsp;
“I hear you.&nbsp; I can only speak to you of her presence here in Washington.”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most important, Broadhurst insisted that the blond woman seen entering
the townhouse with Hart on Friday night had left minutes later with Broadhurst
and the second woman through a garage that opened onto the rear alley behind
Hart's townhouse. That was during the time Clifton was getting the rental
car.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Broadhurst said he came and went twice that night through the rear garage,
which was operated by an electronic key he kept in his car.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“If you have access to a garage at the rear of Hart's house, how come we
saw him driving around looking for a parking space on the street? And why
does he park his own car overnight on the street?” Savage asked.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I don't know, ” Broadhurst said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Possible comings and goings through the rear alley garage - - out of the
sight of reporters for part of the time -- became central to the Hart campaign's
attack against The Herald's story.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While Herald reporters wrote a second-day story to fix the focus on the
movements they saw, not those they might have missed, the Hart campaign
pounded on movements they say they made and that went unobserved.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The reporters and Broadhurst talked until almost 5 a.m. before turning
in. Instead of producing the women, Broadhurst refused even to identify
them. He said he would tell the women in the morning that The Herald wanted
to talk to them.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At 11 a.m., McGee knocked on the front door of Broadhurst's townhouse.
No one answered the knock. Hart's townhouse was similarly empty.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
McGee spotted a Denver Post Washington bureau reporter knocking on Broadhurst's
door. He provided the first indication of media attention to come. It built
from skepticism and ambivalence -- The New&nbsp; York Times played its
first account on Page 12 beneath the headline Hart and paper in dispute
over article -- to a raging controversy, sweeping both Hart and The Herald
before it.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>DONNA RICE EMERGES</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In those first-day accounts, she was merely the “mysterious blond” from
Miami seen with the Democratic Party's leading contender. It was the Hart
campaign that identified her as Donna Rice, 29, and revealed that Hart
had previously met her at a New Year's Eve party that he attended with
his wife.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the confrontation interview, Hart had adamantly refused to divulge her
name. As for his wife Lee knowing the blond, he had said: “I don't know.&nbsp;
She might. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The scramble was on to find her; some quickly did.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Throughout Sunday, Herald reporters prepared a profile of a Miami actress
named Donna Rice. But then they decided not to run the story in Monday's
editions because they were not sure it was the same Donna Rice seen with
Hart.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the world couldn't wait. The volatile elements of sex, power and politics
exploded Monday. Suddenly, there were scores of pictures of a sultry-eyed
Donna Rice: modeling swimsuits, posing in ads for hotels, standing in a
redneck bar draped in a Confederate flag with a breast exposed.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The New York Post adorned its Tuesday cover with a suggestive photo of
Rice and the screaming headline: I didn't sleep with Gary Hart. In The
New York Daily News, she was in a swimsuit next to the words: “Gary is
not my lover. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Even The New York Times bumped the story to the front page, albeit under
the measured headline: “An actress in turmoil. ” By now the Hart saga led
the network evening news shows. The Herald was bathed in the same fire.
Its stakeout was the target of particular criticism. Hart remained behind
tightly closed doors in Washington.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then appeared Donna Rice. And Bimini.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Within the protective care of lawyer Tom McAliley, a drawling good ol'
boy who had known Hart since 1972, Rice agreed to meet the press.&nbsp;
McAliley invited a hand--picked group of reporters to come to his office.&nbsp;
She appeared wearing a navy blue dress and pumps and the look of a wronged
Southern belle.&nbsp; She and “Gary” were just friends, Rice said. They
had not made love; she preferred younger men.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Under McAliley's guidance, she gave her account of how the two couples
moved innocently back and forth between the Capitol Hill townhouses, unseen
by reporters. And, like Broadhurst, she insisted that the Herald team missed
them leaving from Hart's&nbsp; townhouse Saturday afternoon to take a drive
in suburban Virginia.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But she also undermined the Hart defenses in other ways, large and small.
Rice, for example, described phone calls in which Hart would unload his
woes to her about the treatment he was facing on the “womanizing” issue.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hart, who originally said the calls were about “nothing, ” later said they
talked about her joining his campaign as some kind of liaison with rock-music
groups.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And she provided fresh details of the yacht party at which she and Hart
met.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“All right. OK. Here we go, ” she said when asked about the meeting. “I
was at a party, at a resort here, and a number of people . . . decided
to go aboard a boat that (belonged to) a friend of ours that was docked
outside, having no idea it had been chartered, obviously. So we walked
on the boat and, lo and behold, there were two gentlemen there who came
to be known as Bill Broadhurst and Gary Hart. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mostly, however, there was Bimini.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The voyage to Bimini exploded into the headlines like cymbals clashing.
Rice volunteered that the same foursome --Hart, Broadhurst and Broadhurst's
job seeker, Lynn Armandt -- had traveled there several weeks before and
spent a night. They slept on separate boats, she said. She saw nothing
unusual about such a trip with two married men and two single women.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hart had called and invited her, Rice said, contradicting his later account.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The yacht had had to stay overnight because the Customs office in Bimini
had closed, both Rice and Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was later learned that the yacht had routinely checked through Bahamian
Customs on arrival and left the next day without checking out.&nbsp; “Yachts
need not clear out,” said Garth Greene, assistant comptroller with Bahamian
Customs in Nassau.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Hart remained in seclusion in Washington. Lee Hart had not budged
from Denver, unable to fly because of a sinus infection, aides said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The following day, a noon news conference with Rice was abruptly canceled
and she, too, went into hiding. The second woman, Lynn Armandt, has yet
to meet with reporters, leaving one possibly important side of the story
untold.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>HART COUNTERATTACK</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By late Monday, there were two stories:&nbsp; the story of Gary&nbsp; Hart
struggling to save his candidacy, and the story of The Herald's handling
of the story.&nbsp; Herald Executive Editor Meriwether and Managing Editor
Pete Weitzel spent Day Two of the Hart saga responding to questions about
the Herald's story and its ethics. Television crews tramped in and out
of the newsroom.&nbsp; Meriwether's day began with a radio interview at
7 a.m. and stretched through 11:30 p.m., when the nearly exhausted editor
defended his decisions on ABC's Nightline. The Herald even invited readers
to call in their comments as to whether too much fuss was being made over
the story.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By a 2-1 margin, the readers said yes. But somewhere in that period, the
tide of the debate seemed to turn and run away from Gary Hart.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The media's feeding frenzy, heightened by Rice's revelation of the Bimini
trip and emerging inconsistencies between her account and that of Hart's
campaign, backed the candidate into a corner. Other rumored liaisons emerged,
most of them without substance.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the same time, there was new support for the Herald account. The Washington
Times reported that Donna Rice had a book from Hart that was inscribed,
“This is in lieu of flowers until we meet. Love, Gary. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since walking away from the Herald reporters in the alley Saturday night,
Hart had sealed himself off, trying to save his wounded candidacy.&nbsp;
But in an extraordinary and ironic coincidence, he was locked into delivering
a speech to the American Newspaper Publishers Association in New York on
Tuesday.&nbsp; It was here that Hart would make his stand.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
His defense against the flood of allegations was to launch a bitter, frontal
attack on the Herald reporters and the paper's first-day story.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In an angry voice, Hart declared: “The story was written by reporters who,
by their own admission, undertook a spotty surveillance, who reached inaccurate
conclusions based on incomplete facts, who, after publishing a false story,
now concede they may have gotten it wrong. And who, most outrageously,
refused to interview the very people who could have given them the facts
before filing their story. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was a bold attempt to discredit the accuser. But the audience, and the
press, wasn't persuaded. In a short question- and-answer session, two publishers
demanded more details of his yacht trip and his phone calls.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Herald Publisher Richard G. Capen defended the “essential correctness of
our story” and upbraided Hart. “Clearly, at a minimum, there was an appearance
of impropriety. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Other reporters mobbed Fiedler, who had gone to cover the speech and found
himself a part of that day's story. To Hart's main point - - that The Herald
had refused to interview “the very people who could have given them the
facts” -- Fiedler told of the entreaties to Hart on Saturday night for
the opportunity to speak with his acquaintances.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The attack on The Herald was lost in the gathering media storm. NBC gave
Hart and Fiedler equal time in its report on the speech, then concluded
by disclosing that the yacht on which Hart and Rice went to Bimini was
called the Monkey Business.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Hart campaign limped into New Hampshire the following day. The candidate
was joined by Lee Hart for a brave attempt to press on in the face of adversity.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the campaign was now trapped in a whirlpool of despair.&nbsp; At a
51-minute press conference at Dartmouth College on Wednesday – ironically
the site of his rise to prominence in the 1984 campaign --Hart confronted
the most hostile questioning of his career.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Do you think adultery is immoral? ” one asked.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Yes, ” Hart said.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Have you ever committed adultery? ” came the follow-up.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I don't have to answer that question. ”</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hart now stood alone to face the hurricane. It was The Washington Post
that administered the coup de grace to the Hart campaign, presenting the
candidate with evidence of yet another extramarital relationship.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A few hours later, Hart and his wife left New Hampshire to return to their
home on Troublesome Gulch Road in Kittredge, Colo.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
CBS, meanwhile, aired a tourist's videotape that showed Hart on the Monkey
Business with an unidentified blond woman, not Rice. The footage included
the same woman strutting in a bikini before a crowd of wolf-whistlers during
a “hot bod” contest at a South Florida bar.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>POSTSCRIPT</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At noon Friday, Meriwether invited McGee, Savage and Fiedler into his office
to watch live coverage of Hart's announcement. There was an uncomfortable
silence as Hart aimed a final blast at the press for driving him from the
race. Then he turned from the podium and left the room.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Herald's switchboard was immediately flooded with calls. All were answered
with a one-line reply from Meriwether.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“We take no joy in the announcement Mr. Hart made today. ”</font></font></b>
