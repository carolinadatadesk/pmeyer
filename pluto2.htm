<center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+3>Journalism Educators
and the Journey to Pluto:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+3>Who Will Go and How?*</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>By Edmund B. Lambeth</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>In 1966 Georgia Congressman
Charles Weltner, one of only two southerners to vote for the 1964 Civil
Rights Act, faced a momentous decision. A 39-year-old Democrat with a promising
political future, Weltner had routinely signed a loyalty oath binding members
to back all the party’s candidates at the polls.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Yet, the state’s Democrats
had nominated segregationist Lester Maddox for governor. Vowing not to
"compromise with hate," Weltner resigned his congressional seat rather
than vote for Maddox. It was a decision that stunned many, forcing colleagues
and voters to ponder an unusual act of moral courage. Weltner’s friends,
however, found his choice decidedly in character.<sup>1</sup></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The widely publicized
resignation of publisher Jay T. Harris to protest the pressure of high
profit margins on journalistic quality at the San Jose <i>Mercury News</i>
gave our craft/profession a Weltner-like decision to remember, ponder,
and – if we wish – to act upon. Unexpectedly to many, but not to those
who know him best, Harris slapped the waters of corporate culture hard
and straight enough for many of us to glimpse the bottom. "I resigned because
I was concerned about the future of the whole of the paper, the business
side and the news side," Harris said, adding: "I resigned because I could
no longer live with the widening gap between creed and greed."<sup>2</sup></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>"History will record,"
said outgoing ASNE president Rich Oppel, editor of the Austin <i>American-Statement</i>,
"that this was the most powerful speech ever given at ASNE."<sup>3</sup>
Rem Reider, editor of the <i>American Journalism Review,</i> wrote that
it was "clear (Harris) hopes his high profile exit will be a catalyst in
reversing the direction in which the newspaper business seems to be careening."<sup>4</sup></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Knight-Ridder corporate
leaders regretted Harris’ departure, lauded his role at the <i>Mercury
News</i>, but questioned his conclusion that the newspaper was "trending
in the wrong direction."<sup>5</sup> In a trade magazine column Knight
Ridder chairman and CEO Tony Ridder argued that "quality journalism has
endured" despite continuing recent declines in advertising and increases
in the price of newsprint at the newspaper.<sup>6</sup></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Harris’ statement of his
case to the American Society of Newspaper Editors (which is available on
the Poynter Institute website) made waves across the country. No reading
of his full remarks can reasonably question that his was an act of conscience,
closely reasoned and carefully executed. One response – natural enough,
but insufficient – is to put the Harris episode under the rubric of an
excellent micro case study for next semester’s media ethics course and
move on.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>However, Harris’ action
invites us as media ethicists to think about our obligations at the level
where corporate decisions to cut newsroom resources can potentially affect
not only the news media’s role in democracy, but their viability as a business
with a public trust. How can we respond in our teaching, research, and
service to these larger and troubling conditions in the news business?
How can we help to preserve journalism as a vocation with a public trust?
Harris described himself as "at the symbolic center of a debate that extends
in substance and consequence well beyond circumstances surrounding my resignation
as publisher of the Mercury <i>News.</i>" He goes on to ask:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>"When the interests of
readers and shareholders are at odds, which takes priority? When the interests
of the community and shareholders are at odds, which take priority? When
the interests of the nation in an informed citizenry and the demands of
shareholders for ever-increasing profits are at odds, which take priority?"</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>He said daily journalism
has been subjected to a "tyranny of the markets." He cites an exchange
between <i>NewsHour </i>correspondent Terrence Smith and Lauren Rich Fine,
a media analyst for Merrill Lynch.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Smith: "Well...what profit
margin does Wall Street expect from a newspaper, a publicly held newspaper
company? If they average in the 20s, is that enough? What does it have
to be?"</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Fine: "Well, it’s never
enough, of course. This is Wall Street we’re talking about."</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>As much as that exchange
between Smith and Fine appears to have moved and shaken Harris, so did
the following early passage in his ASNE speech affect me. Here’s part of
how Harris described the critically important meeting that prompted his
resignation:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>"What troubled me – something
that had never happened before in all my years in the company – was that
little or no attention was paid to the consequences of achieving ‘the number.’
There was virtually no discussion of the damage that would be done to the
quality and aspirations of the <i>Mercury News</i> as a journalistic endeavor
or to its ability to fulfill its responsibilities to the community. As
important, scant attention was paid to the damage that would be done to
our ability to compete and grow the business."</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Figuratively, this distinguished
publisher, journalist, and former professor (at Northwestern University)
comes and politely sticks a finger in our eye, and we educators find ourselves
asking, "How can <i>I
</i>respond to what seems to be an intractable economic,
media leadership and management problem?"</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>One thing is for sure.
Working journalists and those allied closely with them are taking the Harris
episode very seriously.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The Poynter Institute
for Media Studies and the Committee of Concerned Journalists created sections
on their websites to receive feedback from reporters and editors across
the country on the permanent effects of cutbacks in their newsrooms. Jim
Naughton, the Poynter President and formerly an editor with the Philadelphia
<i>Inquirer,
</i>said
practitioners have been "too easily dismissed when they protest that journalism
is suffering because of a concentration on satisfying shareholders." Naughton
said he hopes that "facts about the real effects" will reach the public
and give substance to the dialogue triggered by Harris’ public resignation.<sup>7</sup>
Comments are being received at </font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1><a href="mailto:noblesound@poynter.org">noblesound@poynter.org</a>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Geneva Overholser, a national
columnist, former editor of the Des Moines <i>Register</i> and now occupant
of the Hurley Chair for the Missouri School of Journalism, emphasizes the
importance of helping the public hear and understand Harris’ message. "For
it’s their right-to-know that is abridged when shareholder interests dominate."
She said it is important to determine whether cutbacks in newsrooms are
linked in verifiable ways with a decline of journalistic excellence, adding:
"And – especially in terms of reaching publishers – connections between
the cuts and the criticisms readers have." <sup>8</sup></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>David Laventhol, former publisher
of the Los Angeles <i>Times</i> and now publisher and editorial director
of the <i>Columbia Journalism Review, </i>suggested, among other things,
that "if newspapers report on themselves warts and all," benefits could
ensue. "If readers understood newspaper economics, they could become powerful
allies in offering support for new philosophies of profitability" that
are more friendly to the idea of journalism as a wise and essential investment
rather than a drain on the bottom line.<sup>9</sup></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>In the midst of the debate
triggered by Harris’ resignation,
<i>Editor &amp; Publisher</i> polled
77 publishers and 62 editors across the nation. By a ratio of 4-to-3, they
said "margin management" is bad for newspapers. Although not all news media
would disclose their profit margins, almost four of 10 said they fall in
the 30% to 39% range, with about as many saying their margins range from
20% to 29%. In other industries the profit margin norm is only 15% to 20%,
according to <i>E&amp;P</i>.<sup>10</sup></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>To Frank A. Blethen, majority
owner, publisher, and CEO of the Seattle <i>Times,</i> "our nation’s newspaper
and journalistic voices are less diverse, independent, and bold than ever
before." He called for "radical action," such as limits on concentration
in ownership of news media and changes in tax laws "that drive privately
held newspapers into public-chain hands."<sup>11</sup></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>There is a sense in which
the sharp introspection caused by the Harris resignation was prefigured
by three important developments. First, in broadest terms, is the attention
to ethics, credibility, and values in journalism, which began in the 1970s
and 1980s and shows no sign of abating. As it grew within academe and the
profession, it helped prepare us to examine the practices of journalism
as they affect the health of democratic public life. Others might prefer
to say we actually are discussing whether enlightened capitalism will reawaken
soon enough to save a democratic press from death by commercialism.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The second development was
the Project on the State of the American Newspaper. The idea was originated
by Gene Roberts as he returned to the University of Maryland after a stint
as managing editor of the New York <i>Times, </i>and was funded by a $2
million grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts. It gave birth to 18 stories
in the <i>American Journalism Review</i>, between May 1998 and January
2000. As an outgrowth of the project the University of Arkansas Press published
the first of two books, "Leaving Readers Behind: The Age of Corporate Newspapering."</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>(www.uapress.com). Roberts
is Editor-in-Chief. Thomas Kunkel, dean of the Philip Merrill College of
Communications at Maryland, and freelance writer Charles Layton are general
editors.<sup>12</sup></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Third, the organization in
the late 1990s of the Committee of Concerned Journalists, brought together
reporters, editors, photojournalists, and journalism educators to discuss
contemporary journalism with citizens. The ultimate goal was to critique
journalism’s contemporary practices so as to refresh its ideals and energize
its commitment to the public good. The hope was to inform and inspire the
public to claim ownership of its own vital stake in a healthy and energetic
free press.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The leaders of the CCJ-funded
research project (also supported by Pew Charitable Trusts) are Bill Kovach,
veteran editor and former director of the Nieman Foundation, and Tom Rosenstiel,
former media critic for the Los Angeles <i>Times</i>, and currently director
of the Project for Excellence in Journalism. Crown Publishers of New York
this year issued the first edition of <i>The Elements of Journalism</i>,
in which the authors congealed the reflections stimulated by the project’s
public forums, citizen surveys, and in-depth dialogue with citizens and
fellow journalists.<sup>13</sup></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>In his review of the book,
Professor Carl Sessions Stepp of the University of Maryland, described
it as "heartfelt, convincing, eloquent, and accessible, but also frustrating."
He concluded: "It is almost as if the authors have won us over their concept
of journalistic excellence and then told us it is located on the planet
Pluto. All we need to do is figure out how to go there and retrieve it."<sup>14</sup></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I agree with Stepp, yet I
believe that <i>The Elements of Journalism</i> can be an effective invitation
to those whom we want to join in the task of journalistic renewal. I have
in mind not only our journalism students, but other students enrolled on
our campuses, and,
<i>most critically,</i> the reachable public. Moreover,
if goals for space travel and journalism can be compared, it will take
as much energy, imagination, and persistence to renew and sustain excellent
journalism as to actually reach Pluto. That’s especially so given the current
sacredness of the bottom line.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>That leads to "Go to Pluto"
<b>RecommendationNo.
1</b>:<i> </i><b>Create Journalism &amp; Democracy courses available to
students on American campuses. These courses can be configured in at least
two ways. One can serve as a capstone course to encourage journalism students
to think deeply about the democratic role of the news media. Another configuration
would be an extension or service-learning approach to the course. It would
need to include media literacy and demonstrate how citizens can not only
recognize good journalism, but interact with news media to encourage excellence.</b></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The goal would be to help
citizens assess local news media performance, define their own stake in
good journalism, and expand their use of news media to better monitor government
and social institutions.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Journalism professors, especially
tenured ones with cyberspace skills and experience in community journalism,
can create civic websites and community fora that could fit like a nesting
block into both of the courses alluded to above.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Thus, <b>Recommendation No.
2</b>: <b>Establish local websites to help democratic citizens relate effectively
to, learn from, and evaluate fairly, the performance of local news media.</b></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>In fact, John McManus is
directing a special media watchdog project by KTEH public television in
San Jose known as "Grade the News." It’s a Bay Area website enterprise
<a href="http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/www.gradethenews.org">(www.gradethenews.org)</a>
that elicits reactions, criticism, and suggestions from citizens to local
news media as well as relevant perspectives from academe and elsewhere.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>For a variety of reasons,
news stories often fail to recognize or address, in-depth, the moral dimension
of major public issues – local, national, and global. Yet, I am not aware
that the current cadre of media critics and their supporters and counterparts
in academe have begun to explicitly discuss the challenges of such coverage.
Thus, for <b>Recommendation No. 3: Journalism educators and can usefully
conduct research and write clearly for their students, journalists, and
citizens on how best to cover ethical issues in the news. These include,
among others, genetic medicine, environmental pollution, human rights,
and humanitarian intervention in ethnic conflicts at home and abroad. Journalism
educators, however, can learn much from major journalism reviews that needs
to be incorporated into their own teaching, research and service. Too many
of us have failed to read the menu of media criticism in North America,
let alone sup at a common table with thoughtful critics.</b></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>However, on the economics
front, individual workers in the academic vineyard are beginning to create
new knowledge about the relationship between newsroom investments, circulation,
market penetration, and the management of profit margins by publicly-owned
media companies. Stephen Lacey, director of the School of Journalism at
Michigan State University, and Hugh J. Martin published a study three years
ago of the economic performance of Thomson newspapers with other newspapers
in comparable communities. "The results," they wrote, "indicate that high
short-run profit margins are associated with declining circulation and
circulation revenue." They estimated that Thomson’s high profit requirements
between 1980 and 1990 cost the company $1.33 million in subscription revenue,
"a figure that does not count possible losses in advertising lineage because
of declining penetration." They concluded that Thomson’s high profit requirements
eroded circulation and circulation revenues. Their findings supported the
warnings of Leo Bogart and others that "cutting costs to obtain high profits
will have negative long-run effects on newspapers." Lacey and Professor
Mary Alice Shaver are continuing and expanding this line of research to
discover more about the relationship between higher profit margins and
the loss of circulation by many newspapers in the 1990s.<sup>15</sup></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Recommendation No. 4:
What if empirical and case study research establishes persuasively the
negative effects on circulation of higher and higher profit margins? We
would still need careful analysis and discussion of how best such knowledge
can be communicated effectively to the public, corporate officers, individual
shareholders, large institutional investors, plus reporters and shirt-sleeve
editors themselves.</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>One could argue that such
a task is naive, daunting, difficult, risky, and premature. Yet, we know
much more about the practice, process, effects, and public benefits of
journalism than we have yet communicated to citizens now grown skeptical
of our credibility. It would require a special alignment of the knowledge,
experience, and insights of media researchers, journalists, and citizens
themselves for such an alignment to materialize. Is this a tossed salad
too exotic for anyone’s appetite for change? Certainly, it would require
virtuoso leadership. But were we able to persuade ourselves of its merit,
wouldn’t the work involved beat watching the continued erosion of belief
in journalism as a business with a public trust? The point is that some
such an alignment needs at <font color="#000000">least to be explored.
It could meld nicely with <b>Recommendation 5 </b>below.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>It’s because of the moral
dimensions of the news business that we need those who teach media ethics
to be involved deeply in saving the idea within our culture of journalism
as
a business with a public trust. And we can do that only if enough Americans
begin to demand that the idea be more widely practiced in the 21<sup>st</sup>
century than it has been in the late years of the 20<sup>th</sup>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Those who teach media ethics
on campus have not spent anywhere near enough time listening to and discussing
mutual concerns with writers, photographers, editors, publishers, and citizens.
There is more to teaching ethics than even the best advice on pedagogy
from the most experienced teachers. To talk about the common good, we need
to hear first hand from others outside academe, especially journalists
and<b> </b>citizens. Wisely, Phil Meyer frequently also reminds journalists
they need to understand the language and logic of the marketplace. <b>Recommendation
No. 5 is that the Media Ethics Division find ways to demonstrate the usefulness
of working relationships between journalism educators and practitioners
on all sides of the profit margin debate. Citizens from diverse socio-economic,
racial, and ethnic backgrounds are vital to such a demonstration. The intent
of this recommendation is for division members to weave these relationships
into their teaching, research, creative activity, and public service.</b></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>It occurs to me that one
way to do this would be to revisit Meyer’s suggestion more than a decade
ago for an ethical audit conducted voluntarily and cooperatively by daily
newspapers.<sup>16</sup> At the time, I was skeptical of the idea. But
the past 14 years convince me that pilot experiments with daily newspapers
of various sizes could be very worthwhile. His approach included state-of-the-art
accuracy questionnaires, content analyses, and surveys of readers to provide
feedback on various dimensions of news media performance.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>In his book, <i>Ethical Journalism</i>,
Meyer used empirical social science research to, among other things, develop
a typology of publishers. One type was the "statesman publisher," defined
as a person "who is an active participant in the news side for the sole
purpose of making it better."</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I would like to think that
it’s at least a few years too early to conclude that such publishers are
a vanished or vanishing species. However, if an ethical audit could be
devised that is appropriate to our circumstances circa 2001, perhaps its
execution would allow us to re-envision the species. Carefully conceived,
it also might explore the extra responsibility that journalism as a public
trust places – or should place – on the boards of news media corporations
and those in a strategic position to influence their deliberations.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>To find a constructive way
forward, we need to dream large dreams. We also need to reason and act
wisely together in times that challenge free and democratic journalism
more seriously than many of us have been either able or willing to recognize.</font></font>
