<td><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+3>More pulse-takers needed at
voting booths</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>By Philip Meyer&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>It's time to break up the exit-poll
cartel.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Only three presidential elections
ago, in 1988, each of the older networks - ABC, CBS and NBC - had its independent
exit-poll operation. Sometimes they produced different results.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>For the networks, those differences,
when they occurred, were embarrassments. For the public, they were a healthy
reminder that polling, especially under time pressure, can be an inexact
science. Seeing lots of polls with different outcomes kept us from trusting
any one poll too much.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Tuesday night, we trusted too much.
The networks called the key state of Florida for Al Gore all at about the
same time and had to turn around and uncall it two hours later. All were
looking at the same set of data from Voter News Service (VNS).&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>If we were required to have only
one exit-polling operation, we couldn't do better than the one headed by
Murray Edelman, who is also the president of the American Association for
Public Opinion Research. He runs a taut, buttoned-down shop.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Edelman describes in great detail
his work in the previous presidential election in a chapter of Election
Polls, the News Media, and Democracy, edited by Paul J. Lavrakas and Michael
W. Traugott. He recalls how four years ago, when Bill Clinton ran against
Bob Dole, VNS spun out national election projections starting at 1:26 p.m.
on Election Day, with eight updates until 2:40 a.m. Not one of those estimates
was more than two percentage points from the final national result. Its
8 p.m. call was exact.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>But something happened Tuesday night
that made everyone pull back in Florida. One of exit polling's strengths
is that the results can be checked against the official count in the precincts
covered by the interviewers. In Duval County, where Jacksonville is located,
and in the Tampa area, numbers looked wrong. When the problem is dissected
- and it will be - there will be plenty of blame to go around. Both the
components of VNS' projection model and the networks' competitive haste
are suspect.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>In some countries, a discrepancy
between a poll and an election result makes citizens suspect the election
results. In 1988, when Miguel Bas&aacute;&ntilde;ez conducted the first
presidential election poll in Mexico and published the results, the ruling
party announced a failure in the vote-counting system on election night.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>The official results were not released
until a week later, and the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI)
fell to 50% instead of the 80%-90% it had reported in past elections. The
poll, Bas&aacute;&ntilde;ez believes, forced an honest count. That was
the beginning of the end for the PRI's 71-year rule in Mexico, which finally
came to a close in a peaceful election last July.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Instead of detection of fraud, the
primary reason for the creation of VNS was to save money and use some of
that savings for a higher-quality product. It was founded in 1990 by ABC,
CBS, NBC and CNN as Voter Research and Surveys (VRS). Three years later,
VRS merged with the News Election Service, whose specialty was high-speed
collection of official election returns. The result was VNS, and it is
the pooled effort of the original four networks plus Fox and The Associated
Press.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>It is the combination of fast relays
of official returns and exit-poll data that make the broadcasters' election-night
projections so spookily fast and accurate. But these advantages come at
the cost of competition and the safeguards that it brings. Consider what
Tuesday night might have been like if the six news operations each had
its own exit-poll operation.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>With competition, we might not have
needed to wait for the Duval County numbers to turn bad on Tuesday night
and put Florida back in the undecided column. If the state were really
too close to call, the networks using the other exit-poll services would
have been saying so. The one with the questionable numbers might have been
motivated to start searching for them earlier.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>And if there were systematic fraud
at the polls, the presence of multiple exit polls, using different precincts
and different methods, would detect it in a more convincing way than a
single poll would.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Even with the cartel, there is competition
at the level of analysis and news judgment. As he prepared his audience
for the first poll closing on Tuesday night, Dan Rather warned that CBS
might not be the first to call a winner in each state, but that it would
strive to be the most accurate. Each of the six news organization has to
make an independent judgment about the tradeoff between speed and accuracy.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>But competition at that level is
meaningless if all of the news organizations are working from the same
bad data. In time, Edelman and his crew will have to explain what went
wrong - whether it was clerical error, mathematical miscalculation or something
that went wrong with the official vote count itself.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>It's true that if we had had six
data-collection agencies in the field Tuesday instead of one, we might
be even more confused than we are now. But we'd also be more careful about
where we put our trust. The lesson of the 2000 election is that information
monopolies are inherently unhealthy. VNS should disband voluntarily.&nbsp;</font></font>
