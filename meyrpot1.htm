<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><B>Covering Campaign '96</B></H2>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>A report on the Poynter Election Project </H3>

Potter</A></H3>

<CENTER><P><I>&quot;After each election, journalists swear off the bottle.
No more silly scandals or mindless horse-race stories. No more photo ops
and thirty-second smears. Never again will we allow ourselves to be manipulated
by campaign consultants. This time we will stick to substantive issues
whether the candidates want to talk about them or not. And then, like struggling
alcoholics, we take one drink and fall off the wagon.&quot; </I>-- Howard
Kurtz, <I>Media Circus</I></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT>fter spending several years encouraging journalists
to change the way they cover campaigns and elections, The Poynter Institute
decided to study what news organizations did in 1996. Our goal was to see
if those who promised reform actually delivered, and to find out if citizens
were any better served.</P>

<P><B>OVERVIEW:</B></P>

<P>Our study looked at print and broadcast coverage in 20 markets across
the country (see chart A). We surveyed journalists by mail and citizens
by telephone, both before and after the election. We also collected coverage
on randomly chosen dates in the final seven weeks of the campaign. Every
story that mentioned a presidential or senatorial candidate and the election
was coded for analysis. We then grouped news organizations based on their
coverage plans, and looked to see what difference that made in their newsrooms,
their content and in their communities. </P>

<P>We used the newsroom survey to determine the basic approach each planned
to take in covering the 1996 elections. Seven of the questions were so
closely-related that they defined a single concept, which we chose to call
&quot;citizen-based journalism&quot; (CBJ). The seven items:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Sponsor one or more public forums on issues</LI>

<LI>Use polls to establish the issues your coverage will focus on</LI>

<LI>Conduct focus groups with voters to establish their concerns</LI>

<LI>Form citizen panels to consult at different stages of the campaign</LI>

<LI>Seek questions from readers/viewers for use when interviewing candidates</LI>

<LI>Base reporting largely on issues developed through citizen contact</LI>

<LI>Provide information to help citizens get involved in the political
process in ways other than voting.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Newspapers were much more intent on practicing citizen-based journalism
than were TV stations. And there was much more variation among the newspapers,
with some high and some low in intent. The broadcasters were more uniformly
low. (See charts A, B and C)</P>

<P>Because of the more interesting diversity of approaches in the newspapers
and because our analysis of TV content is not yet completed, the rest of
this report deals only with newspapers. </P>

<P><B>RESULTS:</B></P>

<P><B>In counties where newspapers had a high intent to practice citizen-based
journalism (high-CBJ), citizens had significantly:</B></P>

<UL>
<LI><B>More knowledge about candidate stands on issues</B></LI>

<LI><B>More trust in the media</B></LI>
</UL>

<P><B>In counties where newspapers had a high intent to practice citizen-based
journalism (high-CBJ), there are hints that citizens had:</B></P>

<UL>
<LI><B>More social capital</B></LI>
</UL>

<P><B>We found no significant connection between intent to practice citizen-based
journalism and:</B></P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Trust in government</B></LI>

<LI><B>Political participation</B></LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Newspapers with a high intent to practice citizen-based journalism
(high-CBJ papers) had content that was noticeably different:</B></P>

<UL>
<LI><B>More stories mainly devoted to explanation of specific policy issues</B></LI>

<LI><B>Fewer stories containing any mention of horse-race polls</B></LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Journalists at papers with with a high intent to practice citizen-based
journalism (high-CBJ papers) handled and assessed their coverage differently:</B></P>

<UL>
<LI><B>More advance planning and discussion</B></LI>

<LI><B>Greater satisfaction with their coverage</B></LI>
</UL>

<P>Each of these findings is explained in detail below. </P>

<P><B>1. Political knowledge</B></P>

<P><B>Citizens in the 10 counties that were high in intent to do citizen-based
journalism learned more in the course of the campaign than citizens in
the low-CBJ counties.</B></P>

<P>We asked three questions about candidate issue positions to determine
political knowledge in the communities we studied. About 20 percent of
our sample knew the right answers in August, in both high-CBJ and low-CBJ
counties, but in November, significantly more citizens in high-CBJ counties
got the answers right.</P>

<P>The difference is even more striking among those people in the November
sample who had not taken part in the earlier survey. We asked them the
same three plus two new questions about candidate positions. Almost twice
as many people in the high-CBJ counties got the right answers.</P>

<P>Our survey therefore supports those editors who believe that their techniques
will improve voter knowledge. However, it contradicts a cherished belief
by some of them that horse-race polls distract voters from the substance
of the election and keep them from learning about the issues.</P>

<P>We tested this belief by comparing the issue knowledge percentage in
November of people whose awareness of polls was high with those who had
not followed the polls in August. </P>

</TABLE>

<P>More than twice as many of the poll-savvy people knew where the candidates
stood on the issues. Of course, they might have known more to begin with.
But even after the effects of age, education and prior knowledge were accounted
for, attention to the polls explained a significant part of the difference
in knowledge in November. For each 1-point increase in poll knowledge in
August, issue knowledge in November climbed by 0.13 points. Polls, by providing
context for and arousing interest in the campaign, appear to help voters
focus on the candidate issue positions.</P>

<P><B>2. Trust in media</B></P>

<P><B>Citizens in high-CBJ communities were less mistrustful of the media.</B></P>

<P>Well over half of the people in our 20-city sample are cynical toward
their news media. In November, 62 percent said the news media are run by
a few big interests looking out for themselves, and 58 percent said the
media deserve a lot of blame for the way the political process works. But
significantly more of the most cynical citizens in low-CBJ counties were
mistrustful of the media than those in high-CBJ counties.</P>

<P>Even after the effects of party, age, race, and education have been
filtered out, media bashing declines as citizen-based journalism increases.
Media mistrust declined by a tenth of a point on the 2-point scale for
each 1-point increase in CBJ intent.</P>

<P><B>3. Social capital</B></P>

<P><B>Citizens in high-CBJ counties had the most trust in others -- social
capital -- in August and November. </B></P>

<P>In November, 52 percent of the people we surveyed said most people can
be trusted; 65 percent said most people try to be helpful; and 68 percent
said most people try to be fair.</P>

<P>We combined these answers into a measurement of social capital, and
looked to see if it changed during the campaign, comparing the percentage
of citizens in each subgroup who gave the most trusting answers.</P>

</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>These numbers look significant, but we found most of the difference
between high and low-CBJ counties was due to other factors. A re-interview
effect meant that people who thought about the questions between August
and November expressed more trust the second time around. Demographic variations
also played a role: we found effects from education (better educated people
are more trusting); age (older folks trust more); and race (non-whites
are less trusting).</P>

<P>In November, after the election, with the same demographics held constant,
the effect is just barely significant. Our tentative interpretation is
that the effect of CBJ on social capital is potentially important but too
tenuous to measure with confidence in a study of this scope. We think this
finding deserves further investigation.</P>

<P><B>4. Trust in government</B></P>

<P><B>Citizens in high-CBJ counties were less cynical about politics, but
only slightly, and only in November.</B></P>

<P>At least two-thirds of the people in our 20-city sample are cynical
about politics. In November, 66 percent said the government is run by a
few big interests looking out for themselves, and 72 percent said Washington
can never or rarely be trusted to do what is right.</P>

<P>Non-whites, older citizens and the less educated were the most cynical
when the August poll was taken. These groups were still the most cynical
at the end of the campaign, and they had been joined in their dour outlook
by a fourth faction: Republicans. Forty-two percent of the self-described
strong Republicans were in the high-cynicism group after the election,
compared to 36 percent before. </P>

<P><B>5. Political participation</B></P>

<P><B>Citizens in high-CBJ counties were no more or less politically active
than citizens in low-CBJ counties.</B></P>

<P>In theory, citizen-based journalism should increase the rate of voter
turnout and other kinds of political participation. We found no such effects.</P>

<P>Participation was measured by asking citizens how closely they followed
the presidential campaign, whether they tried to convince other people
to vote a certain way, whether they attended political meetings, had political
discussions with friends, and whether they themselves voted. None of these
had any visible relationship to the intent of their local media to practice
citizen-based journalism. </P>

<P>Thus all of the effects found thus far have been inside the citizens'
heads. CBJ has moved their attitudes but not their feet. In a more-closely
contested Presidential election, this outcome might have been different.</P>

<P><B>6. Newspaper Content</B></P>

<P><B>High-CBJ papers had more stories that were mainly devoted to explanation
of specific policy issues. And they had fewer stories containing any mention
of horse-race polls.</B></P>

<P>The movement to change the way the media cover national elections was,
for newspapers at least, a real, behavior-modifying event and not just
an empty resolution. In those two ways, the difference was visible.</P>

<P>We did not, however, find that these newspapers spent any less time
on conflict-oriented stories or on the strategic and tactical maneuverings
of politicians. While our 20 counties did vary on these dimensions, the
variation was not related to their intent to practice citizen-based journalism.</P>

<P>The percent of stories that were mainly about policy issues ranged from
a high of 19 (Portland OR) to a low of 3.5 (Little Rock). After the usual
demographics were held constant, issue content had a small but significant
effect on trust. The more issue stories, the more citizens trusted the
newspaper. </P>

<P>It seems likely to us that this effect is indirect; that papers with
more issue stories are doing other things that relate to trust, and the
issue count is only an intermediate variable. If a direct effect exists,
we should find issue content increasing citizens' issue <I>knowledge</I>.
But we don't. </P>

<P>When the effect of what the citizens already knew in August is controlled,
their November knowledge is unaffected by the amount of issue content that
editors put in the paper during the intervening period. The effect is not
just insignificant; it is about as close to zero as it is possible to get.
In sum, election content as we measured it, has very little to do with
the effects that were so clear when we connected media intent to citizen
attitudes. We'll try to explain why in the summary below.</P>

<P><B>7. Newsroom assessments</B></P>

<P><B>Journalists at high-CBJ papers spent more time planning and discussing
their coverage, and were more satisfied with the outcome.</B></P>

<P>After the election, we asked journalists about the advance planning
that went into their coverage. On a scale of 1 to 4, where 4 was &quot;a
lot&quot; and 3 was &quot;some,&quot; the high-CBJ newsrooms averaged 3.83,
while the low markets were at 3.46.</P>

<P>In high-CBJ newsrooms, journalists gave themselves slightly higher marks
for their campaign coverage: an average of 4 on a scale of 1 to 5, compared
to 3.8 from journalists in low-CBJ newsrooms. But when we asked them what
they would have added to make their best campaign story an &quot;ideal&quot;
story, few journalists in high-CBJ newsrooms mentioned any elements that
would have improved their favorite story. In low-CBJ newsrooms, one-third
of the journalists (33 percent) said &quot;citizen voices&quot; would have
improved their favorite story.</P>

<P><B>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</B></P>

<P>What ends up inside a citizen's head after an election campaign is related
to what the media serving that citizen are trying to do. We found a connection
between media intent and:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Knowledge about candidate stands on issues</LI>

<LI>Trust in the media</LI>

<LI>Social capital (although the connection is weak and ambiguous)</LI>
</UL>

<P>But the connection is not as clear between media <I>content</I> and
these same measures. It could be that our content analysis was faulty.
Or it could be that effects are caused not by media coverage in 1996 but
by something that came before. In other words, something as yet undefined
and undetected (at least by us) appears to be causing both the media intent
that we measured and the subsequent citizen effects. </P>

<P>The newspapers that expressed intent to do citizen-based journalism
in June of 1996 did not get the idea at just that minute. Something in
their organizational culture made them ready for the CBJ approach, and
that something might already have had an effect on the community. The fact
that trust in media is higher in those counties in both the August and
November segments of our panel survey supports this notion.</P>

<P>What is even more likely is that citizen-based journalism involves a
basic cultural change that affects both content and a newspaper's relationship
to its community in ways that we have not yet learned how to conceptualize,
much less measure. The idea offers a fertile field for further research.</P>

<P><B>1996 POYNTER ELECTION STUDY </B></P>

<P><B>MARKETS:</B></P>

<P>Our study sampled the content of newspapers and commercial television
stations in 20 markets across the country. All were in states holding elections
for US Senate, most of which were rated &quot;competitive&quot; by Congressional
Quarterly. We selected newspapers where we expected to find a variety of
coverage approaches, based on their history, public statements of their
managers, and their affiliation with non-profit groups that were encouraging
experimentation. We tried to balance the sample across a wide range of
circulation numbers. Several newspapers were involved in election-coverage
partnerships with local television stations, which also became part of
our sample. The other television stations were chosen because they had
the top-rated local evening newscast, based on publicly-available figures
as of January, 1996. (See chart, figure A)</P>

<P><B>JOURNALISTS:</B></P>

<P>We conducted a two-stage mail survey of five people in each of the 40
newsrooms. In print newsrooms, surveys were sent to the managing editor,
political editor, city editor, chief political reporter and a second political
reporter. In broadcast newsrooms, surveys were sent to the news director,
assignment manager, evening newscast producer, chief political reporter
and a second political reporter. The first survey was conducted over the
summer, with a response rate of 70 percent. The second was conducted after
the election, with a response rate of 65 percent.</P>

<P><B>CITIZENS:</B></P>

<P>We conducted a two-stage telephone survey of at least 50 voting age
adults in each of the 20 markets we studied. In order to measure the possible
effects of different types of political coverage, we asked a variety of
questions about political attitudes, knowledge, and behavior, including
voting. Several questions were added to assess what might be called social
capital: trust in government and in other people, involvement in the community
and in the democratic process. The first survey was conducted August 1-11,
1996, before the first political convention. The second was conducted November
6-17, 1997, immediately after the election. Both surveys were conducted
by FGI Integrated Marketing of Chapel Hill, N.C.</P>

<P><B>COVERAGE:</B></P>

<P>We collected newspapers and taped television newscasts over a period
of seven weeks between Labor Day and Election Day. We collected ten samples
at five day intervals, beginning September 19 and concluding November 3,
the Sunday prior to the election. All stories regarding either the presidential
or senate campaign were then isolated for content analysis.</P>

<P><B>ANALYSIS:</B></P>

<P>Two UNC graduate students coded the content of each story in our sample.
They noted whether stories dealt primarily with the following topics: specific
policy issues in the campaign; character issues; candidates' criticism
of one another; campaign hoopla and logistics; campaign contributions;
horse-race polls; issue polls; ad critiques; enabling information (to help
citizens know how to participate); comparisons of candidates. The coders
noted how often citizens were quoted or paraphrased. They also noted the
author, length and location of each story, and whether it was a spot-news
or feature/in-depth story. </P>
