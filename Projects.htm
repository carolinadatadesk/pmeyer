RESEARCH QUESTION: DOES QUALITY MATTER?</b></font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">THE INFLUENCE HYPOTHESIS: Hal Jurgensmeyer,
a Knight Ridder business-side vice-president in the 1970s, had a business
model that defined the newspaper’s product not as news, not as information,
but as influence. A newspaper firm produces, he said, two kinds of influence:
societal influence, which is not</font>
<br><font face="Arial Narrow">for sale, and commercial influence, which
is for sale. But the two forms are closely linked because the latter cannot
be strong without the former. In other words, quality matters.</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">THE WALL STREET HYP0THESIS: A news medium
is primarily a platform for delivering advertising messages to eyeballs.
Quality journalism and social responsibility are mostly cost without commensurate
benefit to shareholders.</font>
<br><b><font face="Arial Narrow"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font face="Arial Narrow"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Narrow">Problem 1: Measure quality in journalism</font></b><b><font face="Arial Narrow"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Narrow">Problem 2: Measure shareholder rewards
and their correlation with quality over time</font></b><b><font face="Arial Narrow"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Narrow">Problem 3: Find out how to help consumers
perceive quality in journalism</font></b>

<center><b><font face="Arial Narrow">Thought-starter list of projects</font></b></center>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">1. Test the belief that newspaper companies
that take drastic quality-cutting measures to maintain steady earnings
in poor economic times return more to shareholders in the longer run.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">2. Document the supposition that Wall Street
believes quality has no economic benefit by replicating the Meyer-Wearden
survey of analysts (Public Opinion Quarterly 1984).&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">3. Write a case study of John McManus’s Grade-the-News
website project in the San Francisco Bay area.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">4. Designate a small number of competitive
markets for case studies and use accuracy (as perceived by news sources)
to compare the quality of the newspapers. Design it as a print replication
of the Hanson-Potter-Wearden TV study in one or more of their markets.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">5. Use survey research to determine norms
for the ratio of news-editorial staff to readers at newspapers.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">6. Do the same for TV stations.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">7. Choose a convenience sample of markets
where the newspapers are expected to vary by quality and apply Andrew Brack’s
social responsibility measures with content analysis.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">8. Do community power studies (Floyd Hunter’s
method) in the test markets and determine where the newspaper publisher
fits.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">9. Calculate the newsroom diversity index
for newspapers in the test markets.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">10. Determine the advertising market share
that newspapers get in the test markets and compare it to their audience
market share. (This may require developing a new methodology to relate
print and non-print eyeball capture.)&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">11. Search the literature to document earlier
efforts to unpack the components of journalism quality as it applies to
newspapers. Propose ways of updating it.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">12. Do the same for TV.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">13. Run field experiments on customer service
by newspapers in the test markets.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">14. Count the number of civic associations
with whom the publishers are associated.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">15. Evaluate the physical presentation (including
design) of each newspaper in the sampled markets.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">16. Reread Weaver and Wilhoit for variables
that can be updated in our sample markets.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">17. Use surveys or focus groups to test the
public’s ability to detect quality journalism.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">18. Do secondary analysis of the social indicator
items in the Knight Foundation and Putnam survey data to test the public’s
ability to detect quality journalism.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">19. Update the Lacy case history of the death
spiral of the Thomson newspapers.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">20. Write a case history of Milledgeville
and its newspaper.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">21. Build a database from ABC records to assess
each newspaper’s success at maintaining household penetration.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">22. Find a way to operationalize the concept
of a newspaper’s influence and measure it.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">23. Correlate newspaper societal influence
with ad rates, ad volume, and return to shareholders (after adjusting for
size).&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">24. Operationalize the measurement of long-term
return to shareholders.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">25. Operationalize a way to classify investors
along a time-horizon dimension: the continuum from day traders to Warren
Buffet.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">26. Interview Warren Buffet and Donald Graham.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">27. Measure long-term changes in share of
market (both advertising and readership) and find what predicts them.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">28. Develop non-Brack measures of quality
than can be implemented with content analysis.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">29. Use focus groups to develop a PR/advertising
campaign for helping readers/viewers be more effective media critics.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">30. Measure editorial vigor with the Thrift
Index.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">31. Search for a correlation between readability
of a newspaper and the education of its an audience as a measure of goodness-of-fit
between medium and audience.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">32. Replicate Leo Bogart's 1977 survey of
newspaper editors to get their definition of quality.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">33. Do the same for TV news directors.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">34. Evaluate the integration of a newspaper's
online product with its print product&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">35. Develop a checklist to evaluate the physical
presentation of newspapers.</font></td>
