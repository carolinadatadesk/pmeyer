<br><i><font size=+4>Is The Press Up to the Current Challenge?</font></i>
<p><b><font size=+3>Jay T. Harris</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Reed Sarratt Lecture at the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+3>October 22, 2001</font></b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font size=+1>Good evening.</font>
<p><font size=+1>It is a pleasure to be here in Chapel Hill to deliver
this year’s Reed Sarratt Lecture.</font>
<p><font size=+1>It is also a personal privilege. I knew Reed Sarratt as
a colleague, a friend, and a gentleman during the years when he ran the
Southern Newspaper Publishers Association. I am honored to deliver this
lecture that carries his name and honors his memory.</font>
<p><font size=+1>We come together at a trying time in our nation’s history.</font>
<p><font size=+1>It is a time, in the wake of the recent terrorist attacks
on our people, our nation, and our very way of life, when deep and conflicting
forces clash in the national psyche. We know shock and sorrow, remorse,
resolve and a longing for just retribution.</font>
<p><font size=+1>We may feel fear as individuals, but we are nevertheless
possessed of an unbounded confidence as Americans united.</font>
<p><font size=+1>At such a time, it may seem inappropriate to talk about
what might appear a narrow or parochial interest.</font>
<p><font size=+1>But I hope to make the case tonight that three points
regarding the Press are fundamental to our nation’s success in the current
challenge.</font>
<blockquote>
<li>
<font size=+1>The first of these points is that the strength and vitality
of the American Press is central to the strength and vitality of our democracy.</font></li>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1>The second is that a strong, vital and <i>independent</i>
Press is essential if the American people are to contribute wisely to the
course our government pursues as the current challenge unfolds.</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1>The final point is that without that contribution from the
citizens of our democracy, a democracy which places the ultimate decision
making power in a presumably <i>informed</i> citizenry, our chances for
success in any sustained national effort are diminished. And the challenge
ahead of us – leading a global effort to root out terrorism – must certainly
be sustained if it is to be successful.</font></li>
</ul>
<font size=+1>I make this argument tonight because I believe the strength,
vitality and independence of the American Press <i>are</i> at risk – and
the consequences of that given the challenges facing our nation could be
serious.</font>
<center>
<p><font size=+1>***</font></center>

<p><font size=+1>Let me begin then with a definition, and the background
you’ll need to evaluate my case.</font>
<p><font size=+1>First the definition. When I refer to the Press it is
Press with a capital "P" and I mean by that to include not only newspapers,
but television, radio, magazines and Internet operations which have the
provision of serious news as a key part of their mission. I will speak
primarily about newspapers tonight, for that is my background, but my argument
applies equally to the news media generally.</font>
<p><font size=+1>I could fill an entire semester’s course with the background
for this argument, but since you plan to go home tonight and I have a plane
to catch in the morning, let me give you only the essentials.</font>
<p><font size=+1>I will start at the beginning – with our national Constitution.</font>
<p><font size=+1>I believe that this nation, despite its historic and contemporary
flaws, is the greatest nation on the earth. It has produced, with much
struggle, a society unequaled in the bounty, liberty, equality and protections
it provides those who live here.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Are we a perfect nation? No.</font>
<p><font size=+1>But our nation is blessed.</font>
<p><font size=+1>America was endowed with many blessings. Among the greatest
of those, although seriously flawed at its inception and improved only
through trying and at times bloody struggle, is the Constitution.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The Press is protected in the First Amendment to the Constitution.
It is the only business so protected because the Framers saw a free press
as essential to the maintenance and health of our democracy.</font>
<p><font size=+1>And what did the Framers seek to accomplish when they
included freedom of the press in the First Amendment? At the most obvious
level, they sought to ensure that government could not inhibit the free
and widely circulated expression of disparate views, a process they viewed
as a bulwark of liberty.</font>
<p><font size=+1>But more importantly, the government the Framers created
was of a particular sort. It was a republic, a representative democracy.
The ultimate authority to set or change the nation’s course was vested
in the people who would select those who represented them. And for this
reason it was deemed essential that the American people be as well informed
as possible about contemporary affairs so they would be capable of making
wise judgments collectively.</font>
<center>
<p><font size=+1>***</font></center>

<p><font size=+1>As is the case with living organisms, institutions in
society evolve. That they do this is as inevitable as it is unavoidable.
They must evolve to adjust to the context of their times.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The Press is no exception.</font>
<p><font size=+1>At the time the First Amendment was adopted in the late
18<sup>th</sup> century, newspapers were composed primarily of reports
of developments in, or affecting the economic life of, the community, of
events beyond the town in which the newspaper was published, and the opinions
of its owners and contributors. In short, they were "public forums" in
which citizens could learn about current events and debate the issues of
the day.</font>
<p><font size=+1>James Carey, a distinguished professor of journalism at
Columbia University, provides a succinct description of the evolution of
the Press from that point.</font>
<ul><font size=+1>"In 1800 the most common name for an American newspaper
was The Advertiser, Carey wrote. "Take that literally…[T]he purpose of
the newspaper was to advertise, to spread the wares and interests of commerce
and industry…And the relationship between business and journalism was an
intimate one.</font>
<p><font size=+1>"Later, when we entered the day of partisan journalism,
there was no conflict between the business office and the news operation.
They were joined. Crudely put, newspapers sold ideology; business success
and political success were linked through patronage and subsidy…</font>
<p><font size=+1>"But once the press in the late 19<sup>th</sup> Century
declared its independence from political parties and other institutions,
its also had to declare independence from its own business office and from
the institutions of commerce. As a result, we have been peculiarly blessed
in the United States: Organs of journalism have generally been owned by
journalistic companies that honored the divorce of commerce and journalism,"
Carey concluded.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
<font size=+1>The most recent evolution of the Press has been a fundamental
change in the nature and priorities of its owners.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Until roughly thirty years ago the vast majority of daily
newspapers, for example, were owned by individuals or families. More often
than not, the owners were residents – indeed, they were frequently influential
leaders – of the communities in which their newspaper operated.</font>
<p><font size=+1>While there were certainly exceptions, most owners saw
their newspapers primarily as tools for advancing progress (as they defined
it) and secondarily as a means of generating wealth.</font>
<p><font size=+1>In recent decades, the ownership model has changed substantially.
First, we saw the creation of groups of newspapers, or radio and television
stations, by private owners. Then, the ownership of those enterprises shifted
increasingly from private (i.e., being owned by an individual or family)
to public (in which "shares" of ownership are sold on the stock market
to the highest bidder.)</font>
<p><font size=+1>The consequence of this shift and what happened next is
crucial. It was summarized well in a recent article by Earl Wilkinson,
executive director of the International Newspaper Marketing Association.</font>
<p><font size=+1>"One by one," he wrote, "family-run companies mostly interested
in profitability over time – with an eye toward their predecessors’ obsession
with quality journalism, community and politics – were exposed to the riches
of Wall Street."</font>
<p><font size=+1>These companies went public, or were purchased by public
companies and eventually were run by new leaders with different priorities.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The big change occurred, as Wilkinson notes, "as the stock
market became democratized via institutional investors such as pension
funds."</font>
<p><font size=+1>"Instead of hundreds of individual investors, many publishers
were now mostly concerned with 10 or so major investment funds that held
their stock. That, by itself, intensified the pressure on newspaper chief
executive officers to shift their agendas from politics, journalism and
community, and toward ‘maximizing shareholder value’" in the short-term
as compared to the focus on profitability over time that has satisfied
most family owners.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The final addition to this insidious stew occurred as
newspaper companies, which generally did not compete with one another for
readers, began to compete with one another for the favor of institutional
investors. This competition constantly intensified, according to Wilkinson,
because "historical over-performers" kept "raising the bar, meaning the
other companies have to keep up to stay competitive."</font>
<p><font size=+1>In short, when the leader of the pack raised profit margins
or growth rates – frequently by cutting costs – the others felt compelled
to follow suit lest they risk losing their investors.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Let me interject here that the only sure winners – or
at least the most likely winners – in such a competition are the institutional
investors whose favor the companies curry. Their goal is short-term results
and most companies do their best to achieve that goal.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Possible, but less certain winners, are those with a longer-term
perspective, such as employees with company stock in their 401K program.
Their interests are growth and value over the long-term. If managing to
satisfy the short-term demands of the large investors ends up weakening
the value and vitality of the franchise in the long-term, as is often the
case in my view, than investors with a longer time horizon would be more
likely to lose out.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Those most likely to lose our readers. The cuts that are
frequently made, particularly in weak economic times, to move closer to
the institutional investors short-term goals result in a newspaper that
offers less in the breadth, depth and reliability of its daily report.</font>
<p><font size=+1>And when readers lose, the community loses and so, ultimately,
does the nation.</font>
<center>
<p><font size=+1>***</font></center>

<p><font size=+1>I find myself in full agreement with Wilkinson’s diagnosis
of the problem – but we part company on the remedy.</font>
<p><font size=+1>"Is it fair to criticize corporate managements for doing
whatever it takes to satisfy shareholders, as Wall Street annually changes
its expectations and publishing companies vie for position within the publishing
sector?" Wilson asked rhetorically.</font>
<p><font size=+1>He answered his question with an unqualified "No."</font>
<p><font size=+1>"[O]nce the decision is made" to go public "you live by
the rules," he concluded.</font>
<p><font size=+1>I see it differently.</font>
<p><font size=+1>At a purely personal level, I remain committed to a proposition
I laid out earlier this year in an address to the American Society of Newspaper
Editors:</font>
<dir>
<dir><font size=+1>"I neither believe nor will I accept that the current
trend can’t be changed, that the proper balance can’t be restored, that
the unwise is somehow unavoidable or that a course that is inconsistent
with our principles and values must be followed."</font></dir>
</dir>
<font size=+1>But there are reasons larger and more important than personal
principle for taking a stand again this debilitating status quo. They include
the original intent of the owners who took the companies public, the loss
of independence the shifting balance of power represents, and transcendent
national interests that supersede the narrow interests and focus of corporate
executives or institutional investors.</font>
<p><font size=+1>It is clear that when the then-current owners took their
companies public they had neither the intention nor the expectation that
their companies would one day be controlled by people concerned primarily
neither with journalism nor public service, but rather with short-term
profit and uninterrupted growth.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Had they known where the path of public ownership would
lead their companies they almost certainly would have not taken it, or
at least not in the way they did.</font>
<p><font size=+1>They might have chosen instead the path taken by other
owners who had the foresight or good counsel to see the potential danger
and took steps to avoid it. These included companies such as the New York
Times, the Washington Post and the St. Petersburg Times.</font>
<p><font size=+1>But, such exceptions noted, today we see an example of
the law of unintended consequences: a profession devoted to public service
– in this case, journalism in the public interest – based in companies
whose primary objective has become the creation of the greatest possible
wealth for its owners.</font>
<p><font size=+1>This new ownership, or more accurately the corporate management
which operates the company, has decreased investment in what was once viewed
as a sacred "public trust" – journalism in the public interest. It’s priority
now is the maximization of profit (to the extent the market demands) more
or less regardless of the affect on the enterprise’s ability to honor and
fulfill that once-sacred trust.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Let me be clear that I am not saying that good journalism
cannot be done in the context of a healthy business, or by one that is
publicly-held. There is ample evidence that is not the case. Nor am I arguing
that newspapers should become non-profit organizations.</font>
<p><font size=+1>To the contrary, I believe deeply that a good newspaper
and a good business go hand in hand. Indeed, without a good business it
would be impossible for a newspaper to do good journalism over the long
haul.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The point of disagreement is how a "good business" should
be defined. What is good enough in terms of profitability and sustained
year-to-year profit improvement?</font>
<p><font size=+1>Economists differ on this question, as they seem to disagree
on all others.</font>
<p><font size=+1>On one side are supporters of the classic view of Adam
Smith, the 18<sup>th</sup> century Scottish philosopher who propounded
the famous "invisible hand" theory of the interrelationship between self-interest
and the common good. Smith’s view was that a person pursuing their own
interest, while not intending "to promote the public interest" frequently
ended up doing so.</font>
<p><font size=+1>We have learned over the years though that while the free
market can produce enormous social good it does not always do so. At times,
the operation of the free market, the unrestrained pursuit of individual
or institutional interests, can have an adverse effect on the larger society.</font>
<p><font size=+1>A more contemporary economist, E.F. Schumacher, a German-born
economist who worked in England, noted that economic activities propelled
at a "frenzy" by unrestrained self-interest may not be "effective for long"
and may, in fact, "carry within themselves the seeds of destruction."</font>
<p><font size=+1>And maybe that is the most important point, because the
news business – if you approach it as a public trust as well as a business
– is different from most businesses.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Many businesses can reduce expenses more or less proportionately
with demand and revenue without doing irreparable damage to their core
capabilities, their market position or their mission – although the human
costs it should be noted are frequently painfully high.</font>
<p><font size=+1>But newspapers are different. News and reader’s interests
do not contract with declining advertising. Nor does newspapers’ responsibility
to the public get smaller as revenue declines or newsprint becomes more
expensive.</font>
<p><font size=+1>And, I think a compelling body of evidence is developing
that the continuing reduction in news resources, while satisfying to large
shareholders, is eroding the circulation base and loyalty of readers, and
therefore doing incalculable damage to the long-term vitality of these
businesses.</font>
<center>
<p><font size=+1>***</font></center>

<p><font size=+1>When I first began to raise these matters publicly in
a series of addresses following my resignation last Spring the concerns
I raised were largely abstract and hypothetical.</font>
<p><font size=+1>I began then, as I did tonight, by citing the clear-eyed
view the Founders had of the necessity of a free press to our democracy.
It was to them an obvious and powerful need when the country was younger;
at a time when the issues facing our people while new and profound were
nevertheless relatively simple to describe, if not to solve.</font>
<p><font size=+1>And could it reasonably be argued, I asked back then,
that in our almost infinitely more complex world of today: driven by technology,
complicated by an increasingly inter-connected global community and global
economy, made raw by powerful competing interests, that the American people
need to know less?</font>
<p><font size=+1>I said the answer was no.</font>
<p><font size=+1>I argued then that the issues that concerned us about
press performance were not important issues because we were in bad times.
They were important issues for our times, important without regard to the
state of the economy or the level of profits of the news business.</font>
<p><font size=+1>It was a time, I said, when Americans’ will need to know
more and more about our increasingly interconnected global community. They
will need to know this so they can effectively engage our political leaders
on the role and direction our country takes in this unfolding new world.</font>
<p><font size=+1>It is six months later and everything, as we have heard
again and again since September 11, has changed. Arguments I made then
which were abstract or hypothetical now have the hard bite of reality and
necessity.</font>
<p><font size=+1>To explain, let me draw from an unpublished article I
wrote recently with Geneva Overholser, the former editor of the Des Moines
Register.</font>
<p><font size=+1>An essential requirement for a democracy to prevail in
any significant and protracted conflict is the informed support of a broad
cross section of its citizenry, we wrote. American success in the war now
before us will depend in part on whether our media place the public’s need
for information above the quest for higher profits.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The struggle seems certain to last for years – testing
our will as a people and testing some of our nation’s bedrock principles.
Rarely in our history have the American people had a more pressing need
for the information they require to understand the challenges the nation
faces and to help guide its course.</font>
<p><font size=+1>In the weeks since the September 11 attack, news organizations
have risen admirably to the challenge, fulfilling their responsibility
to the nation and its citizens. Some, including the New York Times and
CNN, have distinguished themselves.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Others, which typically give their readers or audience
a much less filling diet of news, have likewise responded meritoriously
in the immediate wake of the terrorist attack. But these organizations,
which together serve the majority of the American people, will soon face
both self-imposed and external pressures to return to their usual offering
of a far less sufficient fare.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Not least among the factors facing many already stripped-down
organizations are stamina, resource constraints, and the need to balance
telling the rest of the news with the need to tell the story of the "war
against terrorism" in all its dimensions, foreign and domestic.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Many newsroom staffs are virtually exhausted. Over the
last four weeks they’ve reached deep inside and thrown all they had at
telling the biggest story of their careers. But it is a pace that they
cannot sustain. It is the sad fact that only a handful of news organizations
in our nation have sufficient breadth and depth on their staff to handle
coverage of the current challenge <i>and </i>their normal responsibilities.</font>
<p><font size=+1>For all news organizations, be they established news companies
with financial progress as their new priority or corporate conglomerates
in which news organizations constitute a minor part of the whole, the challenge
currently facing our nation and her people will be a time of testing and
definition.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Earlier this year, as the economy began to weaken and
projected earnings of news organizations were in decline, many companies
cut their news department budgets, some by levels unmatched even during
the years of the Great Depression or World War II. And those cuts only
exacerbated reductions made in prior years, as media companies have changed
the size and the nature of their news organizations to achieve profits
two or three times the national business average.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Writing in the wake of the September 11 attacks, Felicity
Barringer of the New York Times, reported that, "…American broadcast news
operations are confronting the reality of two decades’ worth of budget
cuts in foreign news." Cuts in staff, she reported, were the result of
"relentless pressures for profits of the 1990’s." During the same period,
the news staffs of many local newspapers, television and radio stations
were pared for the same reasons.</font>
<center>
<p><font size=+1>***</font></center>

<p><font size=+1>In a prescient keynote address to the 1998 Catto Conference
on Journalism and Society at the Aspen Institute in Colorado, Max Frankel,
former executive editor of the New York Times, offered the following observations:</font>
<p><font size=+1>"The market gravitates to the mass and the mass, except
at extraordinary moments of peril, is content with superficial news," he
said. But in "rare moments of great stress, crisis, or scandal… the public
will inevitably turn to the media for guidance and enlightenment."</font>
<p><font size=+1>This is such a moment.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The American people need to be fully and consistently
informed about the challenges that face our nation and the world. For this
to be accomplished, the resources stripped from the nation’s news organizations
to increase investor profits need to be quickly and permanently restored.</font>
<p><font size=+1>All Americans, including corporate CEOs and large investors,
must do what they can to support the nation at this time of challenge.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The CEOs of media companies need to recognize that in
the final analysis their most important obligation is to the public – and
they must lead their companies accordingly. Large investors in these companies
– and the Wall Street analysts who cover them – will need to decide whether
they will put their financial interests ahead of the national interest.</font>
<p><font size=+1>In this time of national emergency, let us challenge the
contemporary leaders of the corporations that control American news organizations
to prove themselves equal to their historic responsibility and to the challenge
of our times.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The American people should demand and accept no less.</font>
<center>
<p><font size=+1>***</font></center>

<p><font size=+1>In conclusion, let me offer a fuller picture of what should
be done. It may provide a handy guide for those interested in whether they
are getting all they should from their local newspaper, radio or television
station.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Several weeks before the September 11 attacks I spoke
to the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists.
In that address I noted that many newsroom leaders were being encouraged,
given the diminished resources they would have to work with, to set priorities
and work smarter.</font>
<p><font size=+1>In that relatively quiet period for news such advice may
have been the best one could offer. And it has a certain superficial logic
if you say it fast.</font>
<p><font size=+1>But it no longer is helpful, if it ever truly was.</font>
<p><font size=+1>In the current situation, and the one likely to face us
for years to come, we have in addition to the normal run of the news to
cover – a mammoth, multi-faceted, never ending story to cover with local,
national and international dimensions. And it must be covered fully so
that readers are well informed and capable of playing a wise and constructive
role as citizens.</font>
<p><font size=+1>It is the conventional wisdom today that "everything has
changed." No doubt, many things have. And I hope that the news media –
local as well as national – go behind that headline to tell us what has
changed, what has been lost, and what has been gained. And I hope as well
that they stay on this task – for the changes will unfold over time.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The American people will need to know much more about
international news, diplomacy, other cultures and other perspectives than
has been offered by most newspapers and television stations over the last
decade or so.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The letters and Op-ed pages of our newspapers should feature
not only local views, and American views – but also voices and views from
around the world. The Internet makes such an interchange of ideas possible.
It is the public forum provided by the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup>
century local newspaper updated with the aid of modern technology to serve
members of the emerging global community of the 21<sup>st</sup>.</font>
<p><font size=+1>This is not a story, and will not be a story, for which
a single daily wrap-up on terror, our response to it, and its impact on
the world can be written or produced. Nor can it be handled with six or
eight bullets in a "Today’s Update" approach.</font>
<p><font size=+1>And even if readers begin to lose interest as the story
and events unfold slowly and without drama, as they occasionally will,
the Press still has an obligation and a responsibility to cover it well
and fully.</font>
<p><font size=+1>But it is not an option – either as a strategy or a practice
– to cover the big story in the way it should be by shortchanging everything
else in the name of setting priorities.</font>
<p><font size=+1>For life in our communities will go on in its fullness.</font>
<p><font size=+1>I came here this morning over Highway 64 from Nags Head
where I spent the weekend.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The drive across was full of visual reminders that despite
the tumult and tension of these days, life goes on as it did <i>before
</i>September
11. In some ways, nothing has changed.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Kids are still going to school and we need to cover education.
Business continues in its myriad forms –agriculture and forestry, light
and heavy industry, high technology and local retail. The road is lined
with churches large and small. You see the promise of America – and the
promise of America as yet unfulfilled.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Children will be born, adults will wed, and the elders
will die. Parades will come down "Main Streets", Little Leagues will play
their games and Rotary will meet each week.</font>
<p><font size=+1>These are the continuing stories of American life, played
out every day in every community. These stories too must be told by the
Press. For it is from the telling and sharing and reading of these stories
that communities are born and grow and thrive.</font>
<p><font size=+1>That too is part of the noble work of the American journalist
– a public servant with a public trust – that must be fulfilled in times
of crisis as well as times of calm.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Thank you.</font></ul>
