streets of Littleton -- and your town</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>By Philip Meyer, <i>USA Today</i>,
April 22, 1999</font></font>

<br><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>&nbsp;<font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>As part of its coverage Tuesday
evening of the mass murders in Littleton, Colo., CNN Headline News had
a well-prepared segment on the possibility that television and movie violence
create a social atmosphere that makes such horrors possible.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>It was a breakthrough. The story
was backed up with clips from violent entertainment and expert testimony
based on academic studies of the issue.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Usually, news media prefer to ignore
this old story. How old? How long has there been scientific evidence that
TV violence breeds real-life violence?</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>More than a generation.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>As in the case of tobacco, the health
hazards of violent television were recognized by experts and even by government
agencies long before public awareness began to build.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>In 1968, the National Commission
on the Causes and Prevention of Violence was created.&nbsp; In 1972, there
was a report by a surgeon general's committee: "Television and Growing
Up: The Impact of Televised Violence." By 1976, the case was so obvious
that the American Medical Association's House of Delegates passed this
resolution:</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>"The House declares TV violence
threatens the health and welfare of young Americans, commits itself to
remedial actions with interested parties, and encourages opposition to
TV programs containing violence and to their sponsors."</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Part of the reason that so little
of this information has filtered into public awareness is that the media
gatekeepers don't like to think about it. It is a problem whose only obvious
solution, censorship, seems unthinkable. Denial is easier.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>One of the most dramatic and convincing
demonstrations of the truth of the TV-violence connection came in this
decade when a prediction made by Brandon Centerwall, then of the University
of Washington, came true.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Centerwall was aware that different
parts of the world got television at different times. Therefore, he reasoned,
TV's effects should show up at correspondingly different times.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>The United States was ahead of other
countries. Our TV broadcasting got off the ground in the late 1940s. Our
neighbor, Canada, was on approximately the same schedule.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Ten years later, just as the first
U.S. generation raised on television reached the vulnerable crime-committing
years, the homicide rate began a steep climb. After 15 years, it had doubled.
Canada had the same experience.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>To nail down the cause-effect relationship,
Centerwall needed a nation where television had arrived late. He found
it in South Africa, where the repressive government had banned TV until
1975. Better yet for his purposes, the low rate of white homicide deaths
in South Africa held constant in the same period that it doubled in the
United States and Canada.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>When he discovered that, Centerwall
made his prediction. In 1989, looking at the most recent data available
to him -- which was five years old -- he predicted that South Africa's
white homicide rate would show a doubling in the period 1985 to 1990, which
would be 10 to 15 years after the introduction of television in 1975.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>It did -- and more.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Looking at 1983 data, Centerwall
could see that the rate had already increased by 56% from 2.5 homicides
per 100,000 in the final year before TV. When 1987 data became available,
it showed the rate had reached 5.8 per 100,000. The doubling took place
on schedule.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>The same differences were found
in U.S. subpopulations. Blacks got TV sets later than whites, and their
homicide rate increased later by the same margin of delay. A small Canadian
town out of reach of the first TV transmitters enjoyed a temporary immunity
that went away after technology brought it into the media mainstream.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>By 1992, when he reported the South
African figures in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Centerwall
had given up on any efforts to get the entertainment industry to reform
itself.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>"Industry spokespersons have made
innumerable protestations of good intent," Centerwall said, "but nothing
has happened. In over 20 years of monitoring television levels of violence,
there has been no downward movement."</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>A national study sponsored by the
cable television industry last year documented and updated the same finding:
no progress.&nbsp; Industry leaders, who sincerely had believed there had
been progress, had hoped the study would document it.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>As in the case of the tobacco industry,
some victims are turning to the judicial branch for relief. Several cases
are pending in which expert witnesses for victims are showing the link
between television and criminal behavior.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Meanwhile, concerned physicians
such as Centerwall would like to see voluntary rejection of violent television,
just as consumers have begun to reject smoking. We should be as careful
about controlling our children's TV viewing as we are about their seatbelts,
bicycle helmets, vaccines and nutrition, he argues.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>For that to happen, the public would
have to become aware of the TV-violence connection in a gut-level way that
has not happened yet.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Most people are aware that there
is some connection. What they don't know is the magnitude: TV may account
for half the homicide rate.</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>That story still cries out to be
told. For television news to do what CNN did Tuesday night -- acknowledge
the problem openly -- is a pretty good start.</font></font>
