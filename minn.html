<br><b><i><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size=+1>The case</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">In 1999, <i>The St. Paul Pioneer Press</i>
uncovered a cheating scandal in the University of Minnesota's basketball
program that turned out to be, in the university president's words, "one
of the most serious cases of academic fraud ever reported to the NCAA."
When the story broke on March 10&oacute;one day before the team was to
play in the NCAA tournament&oacute;loyal Minnesotans widely condemned the
paper for ill intentions and bad timing.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The case raises two questions we focus
on here:&nbsp;</font>
<blockquote><i><font face="arial,helvetica">When does the public's right
to know kick in?</font></i>
<p><i><font face="arial,helvetica">Who should decide when this right is
exercised?</font></i></blockquote>
<font face="arial,helvetica">Among other things, the right to know implies
that journalists represent the public in much the same way that elected
government officials do.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Journalists are privileged to go places
and to learn things that the public simply can't. A further implication
holds that the public should know those things journalists know, for freedom
of the press is justified by the fact that the information is public, not
private, property.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">In this case, the <i>St. Paul Pioneer Press</i>
knew that a scandal was brewing in the Minnesota basketball program, that
the university had self-reported to the NCAA and was conducting an investigation
and compliance review. Still, the paper withheld this information from
the public for months. Only the reporter, sports editor and editor knew
of the story. It was not even mentioned to other staffers on the paper
or to the publisher. Was the paper justified in actively withholding information&oacute;public
information? What does it mean, in reporting, to "have the whole story?"&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><i><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size=+1>The story begins</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">Reporter George Dohrmann got a tip.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Dohrmann, a genial 26-year-old, is an energetic
fellow to whom "sports is everything," as one of his Notre Dame professors
remembers. Dohrmann would normally have been covering the Minnesota's professional
basketball team, the Timberwolves, once football season ended. But a long
and dreary NBA lockout meant that the Twin Cities' Target Center was seeing
no action in the final months of the year. He found himself with time to
pursue something a source had told him. The source said a woman named Jan
Gangelhoff might be able to tell Dohrmann a few things about "the climate
of working" at the University of Minnesota's athletic department&oacute;a
subject of interest to Dohrmann, who had been vaguely following several
leads about the university's basketball team. Gangelhoff had left the university
earlier in the year and was now working at a casino in the small town of
Danbury, Wisconsin.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">When Dohrmann contacted her, Gangelhoff
told him she did have something interesting to share with him&oacute;she
had recently received a letter from the director of men's athletics at
the university, stating that an NCAA compliance review said it was necessary
to "disassociate" Gangelhoff from the basketball program.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Dohrmann drove to Danbury, where Gangelhoff
showed him the letter. It seemed an odd thing for the director to have
sent. Gangelhoff had already left the university, and she wasn't sure what
to make of the letter.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">It was clear that the university had reported
some violation to the NCAA. But Gangelhoff, who had tutored many basketball
players over a long period of time, wasn't sure exactly what the violation
was. And Dohrmann, of course, had no idea how serious it might be.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Back at the paper, Dohrmann took the matter
up with Emilio Garcia-Ruiz, the paper's sports editor. Both of these men
had come to St. Paul within the last couple of years&oacute;the reporter
following the editor&oacute;from the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. At the <i>Times</i>,
they had worked together on a story about UCLA's basketball team that had
taught them a number of lessons about pursuing an investigative college
sports story. One of those lessons was that a university that sees trouble
will quickly look for "a viable explanation they can basically sell" to
the NCAA, as Garcia-Ruiz puts it.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The letter to Gangelhoff, the two thought,
signified that the University of Minnesota had self-reported something.
But what was it? And was there more going on than had been reported? Was
it worth investigating even if whatever they found might turn out to be
a non-story? The university might already have reported whatever the paper
found. And, if it hadn't yet done so, once it got wind of the paper's nosing
around, it might rush in a report&oacute;just as UCLA had done with Dohrmann's
and Garcia-Ruiz's work in L.A.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">They also had to consider the other local
daily&oacute;the <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i>. Competition between the
two papers is hot, and neither has much of a taste for getting beaten on
a story.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Knowing all this, the two considered going
with a story right then. There was some NCAA violation; that was clear
from the letter. Perhaps there was enough here to report to their readers,
and they should go to the university and ask what exactly had been reported.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The other alternative was to try to find
out on their own exactly what was afoot. The UCLA experience had rankled
these two. The team got off the hook because the university came up with
documentation that satisfied NCAA investigators even though it seemed to
the two journalists to be absurdly incredible. They felt it was essential
to get into the paper what was actually going on&oacute;not simply that
there was a violation&oacute;without alerting the university until it was
absolutely essential that they do so.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">George's view, he said, was, "If it is
not in the newspaper, then the NCAA will not recognize it. We have to get
it in the paper." They decided to try to get to the bottom of this for
themselves.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">So far they didn't have much to go on.
There was the letter, yes. Beyond that, there was only Gangelhoff&oacute;a
50-ish, disgruntled, former employer working for a casino, as Garcia-Ruiz
puts it.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">There was a lot of work to be done.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><i><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size=+1>The reporter and editor
and their environment</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">Along with their UCLA experience, the
relatively recent arrival in St. Paul of the two principals at work on
this story affected their decisions about how to handle it. Indeed, Garcia-Ruiz
wonders if the Gophers' scandal would ever have broken, if the only sports
staffers around had been the long-timers that dominated both papers' sports
staffs.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">These veterans worked in a larger cultural
atmosphere unusually unsuspecting about any kind of wrongdoing. There are
a lot of very settled, comfortable Midwesterners in these cities&oacute;people
with deep roots and a powerful pride of place. "Minnesota nice" is the
prevailing tone, and not just in radio host Garrison Keillor's mind. Minnesotans
toe the line and behave decently&oacute;at least that's the behavior they
presume will prevail, among themselves and others.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The dynamic and bustling Twin Cities&oacute;Minneapolis
and St. Paul&oacute;dominate Minnesota economically, politically, culturally
and intellectually. Minneapolis is the state's largest city by far, St.
Paul its capital. In the heart of the Twin Cities area, astride both banks
of the Mississippi River, which winds between the two cities, sits the
huge University of Minnesota. The university plays a powerful role in the
life of the state. Minnesotans in overwhelming numbers send their children
to be educated there and their sick to be tended in its hospitals. In a
far-flung and otherwise largely rural state, the University of Minnesota
is a great unifier. Loyalties to it are fierce and strong. In no arena
is this more true than in athletics. The university has the state's only
big-time college teams, and Minnesotans are proud and fanatic supporters
of them.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">You could say that, in such a setting,
a sports story is never "just a sports story." The price of error in reporting
on the object of fierce loyalty is high&oacute;from public anger to professional
ostracism; maybe even to the loss of a job. And in such an environment,
the competition thinks nothing of jumping on an error even before the offended
source does. This is especially true because, in college towns like this
one, sports reporters tend to grow unusually close to the athletic departments
and teams they cover, traveling together with the players and coaches.
If they are not always "hometowners," they at least desperately want the
teams to succeed.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The last thing most of these sports journalists
want to do is to hurt the team.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The Twin Cities' sports journalism community
was particularly close to Clem Haskins, the beloved coach of the Gophers.
When the <i>Pioneer Press</i> did in the end go to Haskins for a comment,
this was his response:&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"I've been here 13 years. Don't you know
me, what I stand for as a man, as a person? I haven't changed. All I'm
trying to do is win a game. All I'm worrying about is beating Gonzaga.
It's all I'm concentrating on. All I'll say is, 'I will talk when the tournament
is over'."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">But Dohrmann and Garcia-Ruiz had never
gotten close to Haskins. And neither was hampered by the locally prevailing
notion that "It couldn't be happening here." Even after they uncovered
a level of fraud that no one would have imagined, Garcia-Ruiz said, "I
don't think George and I have been surprised by any of it. The thing is,
we never had that doubt about the institution&oacute;that it just couldn't
be corrupt."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Still, the closeness of the sports writing
community, Dohrmann and his editor knew, meant that others would be quite
ready to turn on them if their work fingered some of the Twin Cities' most
beloved figures. There would be an unusually high level of scrutiny. They'd
have to pass a test that they came to refer to, between the two of them,
as "making the story Sid-proof"&oacute;after a columnist in the <i>Star
Tribune</i> named Sid Hartman.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Accordingly, whenever Dohrmann would come
back from talking with Gangelhoff, Garcia-Ruiz would press him about how
much he knew, how much he could prove, and how. They decided certain things
were needed to verify the story: They'd report only things the NCAA could
prove. They wanted everything on the record. And they were always working
with the notion that it could be nothing. "I told (Executive Editor) Walker
(Lundy) the Friday before the story ran that it could be nothing," says
Garcia-Ruiz. "They could have self-reported it all."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">But for now, so determined were they to
get more, to keep the bar of proof high before they counted on anything,
that they didn't even raise the issue with Lundy, or with Managing Editor
Vicki Gowler. It was too early.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><i><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size=+1>Cultivating the source</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">After that first visit, when Dohrmann
had driven over to meet her and to see the letter, Jan Gangelhoff was uncertain
what might come of the contact with the press. She was struggling with
how much she ought to reveal. At one point, she tried to contact someone
at the university to let them know what was going on. But no one called
back.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">George, meanwhile, had decided that, since
Gangelhoff had been close to the basketball program, "she would at least
be an amazing source of background information. I needed to get her to
trust me." He placed regular phone calls, took her to lunch when she came
to Minneapolis, drove to Danbury now and then to see her.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Meanwhile, Garcia-Ruiz was telling him
that he needed someone else&oacute;in addition to the source who originally
put him onto Jan&oacute;to bounce information off of. Dohrmann thought
Elayne Donahue, the retired head of the university's academic counseling
unit, might fill that role. He contacted her. Donahue said that she wouldn't
offer up anything but, yes, she'd be willing to respond if George asked
her about what he was finding out elsewhere.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Now, as Dohrmann describes it, "I would
have a triangle of people I could confirm things with. And then I could
sit down with Emilio and ask, 'What does this mean?' He was doing a lot
of that&oacute;sitting down with Emilio&oacute;and the copy desk was noticing
the conversations. "They started asking what we were doing," the sports
editor says.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">But still the two weren't talking.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Gradually, Gangelhoff began to reveal a
few things. "She said she went on trips with the team," he said. "I figured
she was doing more than tutoring." When she said she had accompanied the
team to Hawaii, he was more confident than ever that Gangelhoff was playing
a pivotal role in the players' lives.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"But I had to convince her to have enough
trust in me so she'd talk," he said.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"...and so she'd talk on the record," added
his editor.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Garcia-Ruiz was not interested in anonymous
sources. Beyond that, he felt that on-the-record comments from Gangelhoff
would not even be enough. He would need collaboration. "We weren't going
to allow it to be a 'he said, she said' story."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The reporter would come back and tell what
Gangelhoff said she'd done, says Garcia-Ruiz, "And I'd say, 'That's nice,
but you don't have the story'." He could just imagine the critics poking
fun at the <i>Pioneer Press</i>, resting their big expose on the claims
of an embittered, former university staffer. He wanted the story Sid-proof.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">And Dohrmann was game to keep trying. When
he works with a source long-term, he says, "I don't just want to convince
them I care about their lives. I want them to care about my life." In addition
to keeping up with the latest in Gangelhoff's life, he would tell her what
was going on in his. He'd keep her posted on his reporting on other stories,
on what he and his fianc&eacute;e were doing.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">And, one day in January, the time and effort
began to pay off.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"I called her, and she said, 'I was just
thinking about you. I kind of have decided that you can ask me things,
and I'll tell you the truth'."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Dohrmann lost no time in taking Gangelhoff
up on her offer. "Did you do papers for the players?" he asked her. "Yes,"
she replied. He told her he'd be coming over tomorrow to talk.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Dohrmann drove to Danbury and sat down
with his source and a tape recorder. Gangelhoff, he says, "is a reporter's
dream. She writes stuff down. She has a great memory."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The story poured out. The size and shape
of the NCAA infractions began to grow clearer to Dohrmann.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><i><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size=+1>The question of timing</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">Back in St. Paul, despite Gangelhoff's
forthrightness, Garcia-Ruiz remained dissatisfied. "I didn't think we'd
get proof," he says. "What was she gonna have to show us?" Something concrete&oacute;a
paper Gangelhoff had written for a player, a taped phone conversation&oacute;is
what Garcia-Ruiz felt was needed, and it didn't seem to be forthcoming.
Meanwhile, the strike was over, and the NBA season had started. Dohrmann
was needed to cover the games. "We didn't have anybody else," says his
editor.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">During the days to follow, as their story
was held, Garcia-Ruiz and Dohrmann would check the <i>Star Tribune</i>
every day to see if the competition had the story. After all, the letter
that the university had sent Gangelhoff was out there. "We always had to
think about it."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Still, the time lag made sense to Dohrmann,
"I really felt I needed to give Gangelhoff room to breathe." Though she
had professed her willingness to talk, she was clearly worried about what
the effect would be. She talked to her sister about it, she told Dohrmann.
She was really struggling with it.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Besides, Elayne Donahue, the former academic
counselor for the university who was his confirming source, was out of
the country until March 1.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Finally, at the beginning of March, he
called Gangelhoff. "Let me come up," he asked. She agreed. They met at
the Chippewa Corners Cafe in Danbury. He sat down at the table, he said,
and she told him, right off the bat: "I can give you proof."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Gangelhoff had kept innumerable computer
files of the work she had done. Unfortunately, she told Dohrmann, she wasn't
sure exactly what she had, and it was all mixed in with everything else
she'd done on her computer for years. The two went back to her apartment,
and started going through her hard drive. They came up with 450 files&oacute;papers
she said she'd done for players, intermingled with personal letters and
other work. And all of it was riddled with viruses.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Dohrmann took the stuff, on discs, back
to his office, and printed it out. Then he put everything into two huge
legal boxes, and carted them over to Garcia-Ruiz's house.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">By now, Garcia-Ruiz had let the paper's
editor, Walker Lundy, know how hot the story was getting, although, "even
then, I told him that I thought it was going to be hard to prove," the
sports editor says. Still, Lundy had begun to expect something big. He
definitely wanted to go with the story, as soon as they could nail it down.
But he understood that the timing was going to be controversial.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">He had a chat with his managing editor,
Vicki Gowler. "This story is gonna hit somewhere as the team is going into
this tournament." Lundy said. He added later," I thought some would say,
'Hey, wait a minute&oacute;did you time this?' "&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Gowler, as it turns out, had been thinking
quite a bit about timing, thanks to a prior experience in which timing
had made a big difference. When Gowler was executive editor at a paper
in Duluth, Minnesota, she had presided over a package of interviews with
candidates emphasizing their comments on education funding issues. The
package came out in September, just as school started, and the teachers
felt it was exceedingly prejudicial. They felt its tone was anti-teacher,
and the paper caught hell for the decision to run the package when it did.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"Since then, I've tried to think about
timing," says Gowler. "Not just, 'Is the story fair?' but 'Is the timing
fair?' We could do everything right, [yet still] feel that the story coming
out now could mean something would happen that wasn't right."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Nonetheless, after raising this fear&oacute;and
talking with Lundy about the story and their options&oacute;Gowler concluded
that the piece should run whenever it was completed. "We knew the timing
would be unpopular, but we knew it would be worse to wait. It came down
to a rock and a hard place. It seemed like the right thing to do was to
run the story when it was ready."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">For his part, Lundy says he never doubted
that having the story's readiness determine the timing was the thing to
do. "You have to have a reason to hold it. Is there a reason to hold it?
I couldn't think of one that didn't have something to do with rooting for
the home team."&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><i><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size=+1>Putting the story together&nbsp;</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">Garcia-Ruiz and Dohrmann spent hours in
the sports editor's basement sifting through Gangelhoff's papers, reading
them, comparing them. Soon they began to make telling discoveries: the
same paper, turned in by two different players, years apart. Papers with
exactly the same mistakes in them, turned in by one player and then another.
It was clear that Gangelhoff's claims were solid. And they had the proof.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"That night, about 1 a.m., we knew we were
good to go," said Garcia-Ruiz.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The paper hurriedly relieved Dohrmann of
coverage of the basketball games, replacing him with a preps writer hired
from the <i>St. Petersburg Times</i> a few days before.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"We told her, you're on basketball," says
Lundy with evident pride. "Now she's our NBA writer."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Dohrmann hopped on a flight to Grand Rapids
to talk to the first of the players implicated by the papers. Then he flew
to Indianapolis to talk to a second player. Both confirmed Gangelhoff's
description of the work she had done for them and others.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">They confirmed, too, that the coaches knew
about it.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">At the beginning of the next week, Garcia-Ruiz
put other staffers onto the job of calling the 19 other players. "We decided
first thing Monday morning that we had to try to talk to all of them,"
he said. Meanwhile, Dohrmann had written a rough draft of the story, without
university or player comment, and Garcia-Ruiz gave it to Lundy to read.
But he was still downplaying it to his boss: "We knew we had what Gangelhoff
had done. But we didn't know what Minnesota had told the NCAA." The nagging
thought that perhaps they had already reported all this persisted.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">But it was soon to be banished. The Monday
phone calls to players had alerted Haskins and other university officials,
one of whom angrily called Gangelhoff to ask her what in the world she
had done. Clearly, they did not have the ease of conscience, the sense
of security, they would have had if all had been reported.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Garcia-Ruiz now shed his doubts. They had
a big one. And it was Sid-proof.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Still, there was still a lot of last-minute
work to do. Emilio called the sports information office (SIO) at the university
and said he needed to talk to the athletic director and to the basketball
coach. The SIO promised that the officials would get back. Meanwhile, said
the editor, "George was going nuts. They could fire up a quick letter and
do all the reporting now, we figured." Still, there would be no story until
they had the university's comments.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">When the next morning passed without the
promised phone calls, Garcia-Ruiz called the SIO again, pressing to talk
to the coach. The team was already in the air, came the answer. They were
headed for Seattle, the site of the Gophers' game with Gonzaga.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The <i>Pioneer Press</i> reporter went
up the ladder of the university. An education reporter called the university
president, who was out of town. Yes, the president agreed, he would definitely
make sure that the athletic department got back to Garcia-Ruiz. The call
to the president worked. Finally, at six in the evening the vice president
for student development and athletics, McKinley Boston, called. Boston
questioned the credibility of Gangelhoff's allegations, saying they were
inconsistent with statements she'd made in the past. Shortly afterward,
a <i>Pioneer Press</i> columnist in Seattle to cover the tournament knocked
on Clem Haskins' door. Haskins delivered his speech about how they <i>knew</i>
who he was&oacute;that he wouldn't do something like that. He was just
concentrating on beating Gonzaga. He'd talk to them after the tournament.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Okay, said Walker, we're going with the
story tomorrow.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">But they still had to reach the four players
on the team who were implicated in the scandal, the editor thought. "If
we're gonna name 'em, we gotta talk to 'em. If we couldn't find a player,
we couldn't say he was a cheater."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"I was real concerned that we be fair to
the people this was landing on," he says. "Frankly, I didn't feel responsible
for the reputation of the university. I figured others were responsible
for that."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica"><i>Pioneer Press</i> staffers at the tournament
drummed up players there for interviews, but university officials had already
gotten to them. They refused to comment.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Back at the paper, editors decided they'd
done all they could. They were ready to go. "At least 20 men's basketball
players at the University of Minnesota had research papers, take-home exams
or other course work done for them during a five-year period, according
to a former office manager in the academic counseling unit who said she
did the work," said the lead of the story on the March 10 front page. The
Gophers' first tournament game was set for March 11.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">That evening was a great time for Lundy.
"The 10 o'clock news had no record of [the story]. The <i>Star Tribune's</i>
website, <i>www.startribune.com</i>, had nothing on it. The presses were
running. I thought, 'Now I know what the Japanese forces felt like when
they came over the mountains, and there were the battleships waiting in
the harbor'."&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><i><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size=+1>Published</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">Nancy Conner's phone was ringing off the
hook, along with the phones at the main switchboard, the editorial page
and many throughout the newsroom. Conner, the <i>Pioneer Press's</i> reader
advocate, had heard of the story for the first time when Lundy read the
lead at the 4:30 meeting the afternoon before. "I didn't know how concerned
people would be about the timing," she said. "I just thought it was a damned
good story."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Now she saw that there was a lot more to
it than that. Readers were furious&oacute;in droves. "People were telling
us we weren't public-minded, that we were ruining lives. We had destroyed
something that the players had fairly earned&oacute;an opportunity to play
this game." The e-mail messages were even worse than the phone calls&oacute;unsigned
screeds, laced with vitriol, bristling with obscenity.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Then Gov. Jesse Ventura entered the fray.
At a press conference he said what the <i>Pioneer Press</i> had done was
"despicable." He accused the paper of rigging the timing so the story would
come out right before the game, all for the sake of "sensationalism journalism."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Lundy says, "I just wish he'd found time
to say that academic cheating is not a very good thing either."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The governor's tirade triggered even more
calls and letters. The tone was consistent: The paper's timing showed malice
aforethought, and its action was inexcusable. "Cheating happens throughout
college, and not just with athletes," wrote Jon Schmoll of St. Paul. "The
fact that you used these students, at this exact time, one day before the
tournament started, is totally inexcusable."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Brian Deal of Lake Crystal wrote: "You
should be more than ashamed of yourself. It's time the media stopped being
the self-appointed watchdog of society. We are all tired of it. Thanks
for crushing the hopes of a state that has endured the Vikings' loss, the
Twins' debacle and the NBA strike. I hope the editor feels he has served
some grand purpose, whatever that may be."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"We <i>are</i> one of society's ... watchdogs,"
said Walker Lundy later. "In fact, that's our job," a role that is set
forth and protected in the Constitution. "We had very solid evidence that
the University of Minnesota was fielding an unacceptable basketball team.
They had corrupted the basic reason a university exists, which is to educate
people."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The university's response, meanwhile, was
swift and powerful. It suspended the four players named among the cheaters.
Two of them were starters.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Sure enough, Gonzaga beat the Gophers.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"We expected them to suspend the players,
but then appeal. People had told me that it was likely they could get a
waiver, so that the players could play," said Lundy. "When we put the stories
in the paper, I didn't know the university would be obligated to suspend
them."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The fans were heartsick. "We don't have
a long and storied athletic history here," Lundy points out. "And Clem
Haskins had taken a pretty average team and gotten them to play better
than anyone would have thought, and gotten them into the tournament: a
bunch of underachievers who really played well together. The community
had rallied around them. It was great. Clem Haskins was the man."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">To make matters even more dramatic, the
behavior the <i>Pioneer Press</i> was setting forth was not the kind of
thing Minnesotans thought went on in their midst. "Minnesotans are proud
of the fact that we don't have that kind of stuff," acknowledges Lundy.
"So, in the middle of this celebration, comes the <i>Pioneer Press</i>
to piss all over everything, presenting this revered coach as a cheater
and the players they loved as cheaters."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Worse yet, he said, "We really have only
this one university, and the <i>Pioneer Press</i> was saying its academic
mission is corrupt. It's a terribly rude thing to say."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">For her part, Nancy Conner decided that
the readers were asking a good question when they wondered whether the
paper couldn't have done the story sooner. "I decided to interview people
here to find out if I was comfortable with what we had done."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">She satisfied herself ultimately. "I ended
up being an advocate for the paper," she said. "I told people that I understood
why they were upset, but that I thought we did the right thing. I asked
readers, 'Should a paper hide information? You wouldn't want us to do this
about anything else [other than sports]. What if we had found this out
about Gonzaga?' Would they have wanted us to hide it then?"&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><i><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size=+1>Column fails to satisfy</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">With so many readers so unhappy, Lundy
decided he should write something for the next day's paper about the timing
question. "Because we hadn't answered the question the first day, lots
of people thought we had timed it. It's hard, in 750 words, to explain
the process." But he thought he'd better try to explain what he saw as
the value of the work, and what he felt was the inevitability of its timing.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The column didn't have exactly the effect
he had hoped. "Silly me. I thought once I wrote the column... people would
say, 'Oh, okay, I get this.' Instead people wrote and said, 'I don't believe
you'."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">By a week after the story ran, Conner&oacute;collecting
a count of phone calls from around the building and adding them to e-mail
and letters&oacute;had tallied about 1,000 responses.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">A lot of the calls were going to Lundy,
and a lot of them were calling him a liar. The number of people who compared
him to President Clinton, then in the midst of his nationwide deception
act regarding Monica Lewinsky, he noticed, was particularly striking.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">What might have happened if the paper had
run a note of explanation on the day the story ran? "I dunno," says Lundy.
"I don't think it would've made any difference. You look like you're feeling
like you have to defend something."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">But some of the others involved think that
being more forthcoming with readers on the day the story ran could have
made a difference.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Managing Editor Vicki Gowler is among them:
"I think that's the one thing I would have done differently&oacute;trying
to explain to readers" what the editors' thinking was.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Garcia-Ruiz, too, says that "had we been
able to anticipate" the response, an editor's note might have been in order.
"But it just floored me completely" how big the response was. "We never
even dreamed that [the story] would be 45 minutes of the 1-hour news report
the next day."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Another vote for a same-day explanation
comes from Conner: "I wish that we had gone ahead for once and written
an editor's note that explained some of the background, showed the fairness
and the depth of the reporting that went into it&oacute;and done it on
the first day."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">She's glad Walker did write such a piece
the second day, she added, but doing it afterward "was in more of a defense
mode."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Still, Conner notes that after the column&oacute;and
following the initial deluge of complaints&oacute;"the supporters came
out of the woodwork."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"The thing is, people didn't see immediately
how this could serve students better in the future." It's her hope that
it will help force universities to "come to grips with playing college
athletics and being a scholar" and how the two can be balanced. "This hurt
some players but, in the end, future athletes are going to have a better
situation."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">As for Jan Gangelhoff, Dohrmann says that
she "has heard enough people say she did the right thing to now really,
really believe that she did. She realizes that what she did was wrong.
So now she's really happy she did this thing to correct it&oacute;so it
doesn't happen to kids in the future."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">And how did Lundy end up feeling about
it all? "I'm sorry anybody lost a job," he says&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"But when I get my gold watch, I'm going
to talk about this as one of the best things I've ever seen happen."&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><i><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size=+1>Impact of competition</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica"><i>Star Tribune</i> editor Tim McGuire
agreed that the <i>Pioneer Press</i> had done a fine piece of work. As
he told the <i>American Journalism Review</i>, which ran a piece on the
Gopher stories, "I wasn't thrilled. I was disappointed" to see the competition
break this big story. But McGuire didn't seek to undercut the work in any
way.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">"The <i>Star Tribune</i> people were very
professional in their response," says Lundy. "They gave us full credit
for the story, and threw nine people at it the next day. But when you're
that far behind and you didn't have Jan Gangelhoff, it was very hard to
catch up."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">McGuire sees this differently. "I think
this newsroom reacted very well," he says, in following up with reporting
that broke other parts of the story.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Minnesota's former governor, Arne Carlson,
thinks the competition that fuels such remarks played a role in the reporting
and play of this story. In the wake of the cheating scandal, Carlson pronounced
the university a victim of the newspaper war.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Garcia-Ruiz understands the analogy. "The
war between the <i>Dallas Morning News</i> and the <i>Dallas Times Herald</i>
killed the Southwest Conference," in his view. "That could've happened
here, but I don't think it did."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Indeed, Garcia-Ruiz argues the competition
made the paper more responsible, not less: "I'll tell you what it did to
us. It actually made us more cautious. We dotted our i's and crossed our
t's more carefully" because we figured that the other paper would be watching.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Lundy acknowledges the situation is "hotly
competitive." Not for nothing is "hell-raising" one of the goals on the
flip chart when his staff sits down at 9 a.m. to assess how that morning's
paper looks in retrospect. And not for nothing is the <i>Trib's</i> front
page pasted up there right alongside the hometown sheet.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Still, Lundy maintains, "On this one, [the
competition] played no role."&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><i><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size=+1>Epilogue</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">In all, 548 <i>Pioneer Press</i> readers
canceled their subscriptions over the Gophers story. (The paper sold an
extra 8,000 copies the day the story ran.)&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Editors usually expect that most of those
subscribers who cancel in anger will return to the fold before long. As
Lundy says, "If you're the only game in town, they have to." But not in
this case. "Here they have an alternative." And in fact, most of the cancellations
have stuck. Six months after the story broke, the circulation director
calculated the net loss at 433.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Another financial hit came in advertising.
The university's athletic department had its advertising reps call to explain
that, thanks to the story, "the mood was so bad" that they could no longer
advertise with the paper. They canceled their contracts, which had been
worth about $30,000 a year.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">A piece of journalistic fallout was the
football team's initial reluctance to speak to <i>Pioneer Press</i> reporters,
demanding that the paper issue a formal apology for the effects of its
work on the Gophers scandal.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">As for what the newspaper's publisher thought
of his staff's work, and all the developments that followed, Lundy notes,
"I had put him in the loop toward the end. You know, publishers aren't
too keen on surprises. He was thrilled with the story."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Eight months after the story, the university
released a report, prepared for it by a law firm, concluding that Clem
Haskins had lied to investigators about "widespread academic misconduct"
and had also told his players to lie. It criticized the athletic department,
academic counseling supervisors and faculty members for allowing the cheating
to occur. Hours before the release of the report, two other top athletic
officials&oacute;McKinley Boston, the vice president for student development
and athletics, along with the men's athletic director&oacute;resigned.
Haskins, who had resigned under pressure in June and taken a $1.5 million
buyout, denied any knowledge of Gangelhoff's activities, and said he had
told no one to lie.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Said the university's president. Mark Yudof:
"I am angry. I felt I was lied to my face... the problem was much deeper,
and... this program was corrupt in almost any way one can think about it."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">The report was forwarded to the NCAA, which
will either have its own investigation and report, or rubber-stamp the
university's investigation.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica">Shortly over a year after the story broke,
it brought George Dohrmann the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for beat reporting.
Several weeks later, Dohrmann announced he was leaving the staff to take
an investigative reporting position with <i>Sports Illustrated</i>.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><i><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size=+1>Discussion questions</font></font></i></b>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="arial,helvetica"><i>Was the</i> Pioneer Press<i>'s decision
to run the story when it did the best decision? How well did it serve the
public interest? Did the public have a right to this information earlier?
If so, did the paper serve a higher purpose by withholding it? Should it
have withheld it until after the tournament?&nbsp;</i></font></li>

<li>
<i><font face="arial,helvetica">Who made the decisions about the handling
of the story, and what principles guided them? Were the decisions professionally
and ethically sound?&nbsp;</font></i></li>

<li>
<i><font face="arial,helvetica">The two journalists went deep into a secret,
investigative mode because they didn't want the competition to get wind
of the story and also because they distrusted the university and the NCAA,
based partly on previous experience. Shouldn't journalists champion openness?
Was it right to keep the story so closely held?&nbsp;</font></i></li>

<li>
<i><font face="arial,helvetica">If these two journalists had been not newcomers,
but longtime residents, would they have pursued the story differently?&nbsp;</font></i></li>

<li>
<i><font face="arial,helvetica">Should the paper have anticipated the public
response? Would fuller explanations from the paper have made a difference
in the response? Does the public unhappiness mean that the paper did the
wrong thing?</font></i></li>
