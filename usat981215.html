much</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+3>as what's in it</font></font></b>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>What product, when used as intended,
causes premature death and needless disability? When I ask my journalism
students, they are puzzled by the question. Why talk about tobacco in a
course on media ethics?</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>But the hazard that should concern
them comes from television, not tobacco. And the parallel with smoking
as an unacknowledged health hazard is real.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>When five teen-age boys in Burlington,
Wis., were arrested last month for conspiring to kill school administrators
and fellow students, police ruled out a variety of theories. The boys did
not belong to a gang nor were they members of a satanic cult. There was
no such sharply confined evil influence.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Instead, it is all around us like
polluted air. And the media business, like the tobacco business, is in
denial.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>When causes are diffuse and slow
acting, they are hard to recognize. If a specific young person copies a
particular antisocial behavior seen on TV or in a movie, the link is clear.
But what if young people everywhere are systematically taught that violence
is an acceptable method of problem solving? A subtle but pervasive effect
can reach the threshold of horror in the most benign locations, as in the
Wisconsin town, without warning.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Among academics who study the TV-violence
link, the effect isn't even controversial. Study after study has shown
that television robs families, churches and schools of their ability to
show the young how the world is supposed to work. TV and movies do the
job now, and teach that violent solutions to everyday problems are fast,
fun, and often unpunished. TV is the main culprit because it is routinely
watched by young children.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>George Gerbner of Temple University
calls this "cultural pollution." Instead of having their values cultivated
by stories and examples from parents and teachers, children are turned
over to the TV set for babysitting. The statistical link between TV and
violent actions is found at every level: in studies that follow individuals
and those that follow nations.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>The tobacco firms, long in denial
about the connection between smoking and cancer, could claim no specific
cancer-causing mechanism had been found. In the case of TV and violence,
the mechanism is obvious.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Children watching television grow
up confusing TV's world with the real one. Even as adults they carry a
picture of the world inside their heads that remains closer to TV's version
of reality than to actual reality.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>And they grow up afraid. A nation
of fearful adults is prone to aggression, isolation, and attitudes supportive
of a police state. In this decade, with violent crime receding slightly,
thanks to temporary changes in the age structure and more vigorous enforcement,
the fear may be down. But it is still higher than the actual risk of victimization
justifies.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Besides the learning, the imitation,
and the fear, there is another effect: desensitization. Growing up with
television violence makes children callous toward the victims. Researchers
have been unfolding this picture for three decades.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>We in the media and media-related
jobs don't like to think about it. We shy away from thinking about it because
the only efforts at reform that seem workable could start us down a slippery
slope toward restrictions on freedom of speech.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Gerbner wants to put social and
political pressure on the producers of television content. In 1996, he
organized a coalition of non-profits and individual citizens called the
Cultural Environment Movement (www.cemnet.org). It is an uphill task.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Four years ago, the National Cable
Television Association funded a study by researchers at four universities
in the hope of demonstrating that television's content creators are becoming
more responsible. That hope proved empty.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>The report's final volume (National
Television Violence Study 3, Sage Publications, 1998) finds that the number
of programs containing violence has remained constant over the past three
years. So has the proportion of violent depictions that have the most risk
of damaging children, i.e., those showing violence committed by attractive
role models, violence that appears justified, and violence that goes unpunished
or has minimal consequences for others.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Television could undo at least part
of its harm by offering programs with anti-violence themes, and sometimes
it does -- but in only 3% to 4% of all violent programs. That paltry share,
the researchers found, is not growing.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Tobacco defenders said smoking was
an individual decision. TV's advocates say violent content is a problem
of parental control. But for those who can control their own children's
viewing, the culture doesn't change. The kids will pick up violence-friendly
attitudes from their peers just like nonsmokers sucking in second-hand
tobacco fumes.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Pollution, whether in the cultural
or the physical environment, can't be managed by individual decision-making.
There is no economic incentive to stop your own polluting unless everybody
else does it.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>That's why regulation is sometimes
necessary.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>My late colleague Vermont Royster,
who wrote for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> from his Kenan professorship
at Chapel Hill, liked to remind his fellow media workers of the possibility.
The First Amendment, he said, holy as it may seem, is not God's blessing,
but a gift from the people. They can take it back. But they would have
to wake up first. Most in the information business would rather let them
sleep. Like the tobacco people, we find our comfort in denial.</font></font>
