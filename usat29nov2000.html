<td><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+3>Glitch led to 'Bush wins' call&nbsp;</font></font></b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>By Philip Meyer&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Democrats have been on the defensive
ever since Fox News Channel declared George W. Bush the Florida ballot
winner in the wee hours of Nov. 8 and the other networks fell into line
like baby ducks, prompting Al Gore's premature concession.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>From then on, nothing Democrats
could do would overcome the appearance that they were trying to steal the
election on technicalities. And nothing Republicans could say would overcome
the suspicion that they had planned the whole thing. That a cousin of George
W. Bush was working the Fox decision desk added fuel to the conspiracy
theories.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>But the fact is a computer glitch
and a failure to get the word out in time are what caused the trouble.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Deanie Lowe, Volusia County elections
supervisor, spotted the problem. In her county, an Accu-Vote system uses
a scanner to read a voter's mark - made with a pen, not a punch - and advances
a counter in an electronic storage device. Results are sent to county headquarters
by modem.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Precinct 216 had modem trouble,
so workers fed its memory card into the headquarters' central computer.
"Gore just went backward," an election watcher said.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>"You're tired," Lowe replied. "You
must be seeing things." Then another observer chimed in: Gore's count had
gone backward.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Lowe ordered all of the precincts
reviewed. At 1:24 a.m., the review showed that 412 of 585 registered voters
in Precinct 216 had cast ballots - but that they had given 2,813 votes
to Bush! Gore had a negative vote: minus 16,022. Ralph Nader's negative
vote was even greater. The problem was traced to an error in the memory
card.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><i><font face="Garamond"><font size=+2>Bad information means bad call&nbsp;</font></font></i><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Meanwhile, the decision desks of
the five networks and The Associated Press, owners of Voter News Service
(VNS), were looking at models that included the negative Gore count. "That
contributed to a statewide number that made it look like Bush was more
than 50,000 ahead of Gore, with 97% reported and about 180,000 votes still
to be counted," recalls Warren Mitofsky, who headed the CNN/CBS decision
desk. "You can't make up 50,000 out of 180,000. I would have made that
call without hearing anybody else's call."&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Mitofsky is the dean of election-night
estimators. His moves are watched by the other decision desks. "Warren
is just so knowledgeable, you do take that into consideration," says Paul
J. Lavrakas, who has been an election consultant for VNS.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>But what none of the decision-makers
knew was that Bush's lead then really was closer to 30,000. The estimation
model correctly was forecasting it would drop by 30,000, so the right number
would have projected a tie - which in fact it did later in the morning
after the Volusia error was fixed.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>The real vote in Precinct 216 was
22 for Bush and 193 for Gore. Nader got one.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><i><font face="Garamond"><font size=+2>Not all made the call&nbsp;</font></font></i><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>The VNS side of this story has yet
to be told. VNS' head, Murray Edelman, gave a previously scheduled talk
after the election to the Midwest Association for Public Opinion Research,
but would not discuss the case. That's a pity, because both VNS and the
AP deserve credit for never jumping on that early morning Bush bandwagon.
We'd all like to know what they saw that the networks missed.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>When they created VNS, the networks
intended it to do everyone's calls. But in 1994, the AP and ABC jumped
ship, with each doing its own projecting from the pooled data. The others
followed - at the cost of disconnecting analysts from their data.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Networks do check each other. But
they all feel the same pressure: If viewers are scanning channels, who
are they watching? The anchor with the winner's name or the one who admits
he hasn't figured it out yet? With a system like that, we don't need a
conspiracy theory.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font>
