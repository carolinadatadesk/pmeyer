<td><b><font face="Garamond"><font size=+3>Extra, extra! Local media battle
for your loyalty&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>By Philip Meyer, <i>USA Today</i>,
March 21, 2000</font></font>
<br><i><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Copyright USA Today Information
Network</font></font></i>
<br><i><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font></i>&nbsp;<i><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1></font></font></i>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Don't worry too much about the big
media mergers such as last week's $6.4-billion purchase of Times Mirror
Co. by Chicago-based Tribune Co. The real battle for media dominance, the
one that affects ordinary readers and viewers like you and me, is happening
at the local level.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>More than two decades ago, when
the effects of new technology were just beginning to be discerned, Harvard
Professor Steve Star told a gathering of newspaper managers, "In the long
run, it will not pay you to be in a market that you do not dominate." His
aphorism is still</font></font>
<br><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>true, except that today it applies
not just to newspapers but also to the convergence of media forms that
is taking place.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>A local news medium is basically
a marketplace like a village square or medieval bazaar. Buyers and sellers
go there because each group expects to find the other, and it doesn't pay
to have more than one such place for exchanging ideas, information and
goods. If you want to buy a used piano or find out who's running for mayor,
you are likely to go to a source that has worked well previously for that
purpose.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>In the few places that still have
two newspapers, you can predict which will survive by looking at the classified
sections. The one with the most advertisements is winning, and neither
buyers nor sellers are likely to provide sufficient support to sustain
the runner-up.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>When media forms combine, either
through joint ownership or through the pooling of reporting efforts, figuring
out where to go and whom to trust gets more complicated, but you can do
it. And whether media managers realize it or not, your trust is what they
need to survive.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>One media manager who understood
this most clearly was Hal Jurgensmeyer, who died in 1995. He had left a
promising career at IBM to apply his talent for analyzing systems to the
business side of The <i>Miami Herald</i> and later the corporate headquarters
of Knight Ridder Inc. A newspaper's product is not just ink on paper, Jurgensmeyer
said then. And it's not just information. Its main product is influence
-- societal influence, which is not for sale, and commercial influence,
which is for sale in the form of advertising.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>The beauty of this business model
is that it gives media an economic incentive for treating their end users
with respect and honesty. If they pander to advertisers and let them influence
editorial content, the public will notice, and both the medium and its
advertisers will suffer in the long run because of the loss of trust.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>As mergers and partnerships bring
different media forms under single management teams, you can expect some
confusion while different business models are tried. The <i>New York Times</i>
and ABC News broke new ground last week by combining forces in an investigation</font></font>
<br><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>of deceptive home-lending practices.
The <i>Times</i> story ran the morning of March 15 and ABC's 20/20 carried
its version that evening.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Because television excels in getting
our attention, and print is better at supplying depth and interpretation,
the partnership might have worked better if ABC had gone first. However,
a third element in the equation, the online follow-ups, helps those who
found out about the story on TV and wanted more.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>The online version offered by ABC
(abcnews.go.com) is the friendlier of the two. It includes the transcript
of the broadcast and a hyperlink to the complete text of The <i>Times</i>'
story at no charge. Viewers who try to get the story directly from The
<i>Times</i>'
Web site are asked to register and pay a $2.50-per-story fee for a downloadable
version.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>A more seamless blending of online
and traditional media is developing in Raleigh, N.C., where WRAL-TV is
gaining trust rapidly by becoming the dominant source of weather information
in its market.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>When the Jan. 25 snowstorm hit North
Carolina, newspaper subscribers looked out their windows in the morning
and realized that the paper wasn't likely to make it that day. Radio and
television, if heeded with enough patience, eventually would get around
to the specific school or business closings that an early riser needed,
but there was a better way: WRAL's Web site had the list, neatly alphabetized.
There was also an up-to-the-minute story on the effects on the area, and
live pictures of key intersections and highways.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Newspapers did not do nearly as
well. The <i>News &amp; Observer</i>, preoccupied with moving its staff
and its trucks through the snow in Raleigh, was slower to update its Web
site. At 7:39 a.m., it continued to lead with the old news of Al Gore winning
in Iowa the day before. "We still move at newspaper speed on a lot of things,"
admitted executive editor Anders Gyllenhaal.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>WRAL's Web site drew 1.5 million
page views that day, its second best after Hurricane Floyd in 1999, according
to John Conway, director of new media.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>Under old technology, media companies
defined themselves by their delivery systems. Print products were created
to move on wheels; broadcast signals rode the airwaves; the telephone used
copper wire. Now their delivery systems are converging, and they need something
else to make themselves distinctive.</font></font>
<p><font face="Garamond"><font size=+1>There is no mystery about what that
something else will be. What the new media forms need to capture is the
favored position in our heads as the trusted source. And if your head is
like mine, there's not going to be a lot of spare room there, so the battle
should be fierce.</font></font>
